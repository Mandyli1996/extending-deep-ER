All you need to do is connect the cable to USB ports on your old Windows XP or Vista computer to your new Windows 7 machine and run the utility.    Easily Transfer User Accounts PC Settings Files and More   Your user accounts Windows settings files and folders pictures and photos MP3s and other music videos program settings and program data and e-mail messages settings and contacts will all be transferred over to your new computer without a fuss. Thanks to the Map User Accounts feature the destination PC is not required to have matching User Accounts. Gone are the days of losing important email messages or having to reset all your user settings Once the transfer done a post migration report is generated which gives you a comprehensive view of everything that was transferred. Because of possible incompatibility issues programs and applications are not transferred to the new computer. Instead the utility provides a list of all the programs and applications that were installed on the old PC along with links to the latest versions of the programs if they are provided by the software developer.     Eight-foot USB 2.0 Cable with LED Indicators   The Easy Transfer Cable is eight feet long and has two auto-speed selectable USB type-A male connectors. The USB 2.0 Hi-Speed cable provides transfer speeds of up to 480Mbps and is fully backward compatible with USB 1.1. LEDs on the cable lets you quickly know that the transfers have begun.

Unique Hybrid Technology   Ovi Maps is built on an advanced technology called hybrid vector maps. Vector maps are high quality but less data intensive and allow you to continue to navigate even if you lose your network connection. This means that maps downloaded or updated across a network connection are about half the size of bulky bitmaps used by other mobile map providers. The hybrid technology ensures that unlike other providers any downloaded map data is stored on the device for future use.   No Network Connection Required When Navigating   Avoid expensive battery-draining network connections with Nokia s unique hybrid technology. Maps can be pre-loaded on to your Nokia smartphone so you can set Ovi Maps to offline mode saving battery power and the navigation system will still work. This is particularly useful for those worried about data connection costs when travelling abroad or when you are travelling through areas with little or no network coverage.

Core technologies like the AZO recording layer give Verbatim an offering like no other optical manufacturer. This unique and ultra-stable layer strongly resists UV light withstands high laser and rotation speeds on newer drives and ensures compatibility with current DVD standards.   Verbatim s AZO recording layer not only withstands the extremely high laser and rotation speeds of newer drives it also maximizes their performance. Verbatim paid particular attention to the durability and light fastness of AZO tests show that it is more stable than most recording dyes and the least affected by ultraviolet light.    AZO also offers high sensitivity for reliable high-speed recording and high reflectivity to eliminate read errors. The thinness of the recording layer is also critical.

Automatically determines depth and makes adjustments to keep the bottom and fish visible on the display.         Suction-cup transducer and rechargeable battery included so you can take it anywhere.      The PiranhaMAX uses sonar technology to send sound waves from the transducer into the water. The returned echoes are plotted on the display creating a very accurate picture of the underwater world including distance to underwater objects such as the bottom fish and structure.   Dual Beam Sonar   The PiranhaMAX 160 PT uses a 200 83 kHz dual beam sonar system with a wide 60 degree area of coverage. Dual Beam sonar is optimized to show the greatest bottom definition using a narrow 20 degree beam yet can still indicate fish found in the wide 60 degree beam when the Fish ID feature is turned on. Dual Beam is ideal for a wide range of conditions--from shallow to very deep water in both fresh and salt water. Note that boat speed wave action bottom hardness water conditions and transducer installation can all affect depth capability.   Fish ID Fish ID uses advanced sonar processing to interpret sonar returns and displays a Fish Symbol when very selective requirements are met. When a fish is detected a fish icon and its depth are displayed above the return that has been classified as being a fish. Three different fish icons represent intensity of the sonar return and provide an indicator of relative fish size.   Fish and Depth Alarms   When Fish ID is on you can set an alarm to sound when the PiranhaMAX detects fish that correspond to your settings. You can also set a depth alarm from 3 to 99 feet--an audible alarm sounds when the depth is equal to or less than the setting.

By utilizing the most powerful PS 2 buffer-system ever created for a gaming keyboard SteelSeries 7G redefines anti-ghosting by supporting as many simultaneous key presses as there are keys on the keyboard. The keyboard features both PS 2 and USB connectors.      The 7G gaming keyboard sets industry standards and has a large handrest for supreme comfort    Metal keys offer an extended lifecycle for up to 50 million key presses    SteelSeries key provides access to the Media Controls via the first six F-keys on the keyboard     Golden Quality and Rapid Response Time   The use of PS 2 combined with a gold-plated USB connector and 18K gold-plated mechanical switches means that SteelSeries 7G improves your ability to obtain more Actions Per Minute than any other keyboard in the world. It features gaming grade response times and more than 6 times the durability of a traditional keyboard.   To put it simply If you need the fastest reaction time highest reliability and the ability to perform very complex keyboard combinations then the SteelSeries 7G is your choice.      Featuring ports for headphone-in and microphone-out as well as two USB 1.1 ports    Experience greater tactile feedback and increased APM with the 7G gaming keyboard    All keys are mounted on a metal plate to ensure durability and consistency    Featuring gold plated mechanical switches and connectors for enhanced durability     Redefining Anti-Ghosting Ever tried pressing a few keys on your keyboard and getting a beep sound It either happens when you press too many keys at the same time or when you press too many keys within the same cluster at the same time like the keys around WASD which often used for movements in games . If your keyboard exhibits this behavior it will hinder your ability to perform certain actions movement in FPS games being one example. The industry calls this anti-ghosting. When using USB you can use up to 6 keys plus modifiers at the same time which is the highest spec limit a USB connection can accommodate.   Increased APM   It gets even better. With the 7G you don t have to press the keys all the way down for them to register. The mechanical switches will register key presses quickly with a travel distance roughly 50 shorter than a conventional keyboard. You will type faster with a consistent tactile feeling. Your Actions Per Minute APM can reach new heights with the 7G thanks to this feature.   Tactile Feedback and Unrivaled Lifecycle   But the 7G offers more than just a long lifecycle. The rubber domes on a conventional keyboard will over time lose their tactile feeling due to rubber flexing. The keys you use the most will start to feel different. The physical construction of the mechanical switches used in the 7G and the strict tolerance levels in which the switches are manufactured is what allows the key presses on this keyboard to always feel consistent.   USB and Audio Ports   SteelSeries 7G is equipped with audio ports for headphone-in and microphone-out and features two USB 1.1 ports making it easier than ever to connect speakers or a headset to your setup. Headphone speaker-out and microphone-in is built directly into the keyboard. This gives you easy access to your audio outlet instead of having to move to the back of your computer when changing or plugging in audio devices. Not to mention plugging in your mouse or recharging your MP3-player or cell phone is closer and easier.   Acclimation   It may take a while to get used to a mechanical keyboard. Most gamers or typists acclimate in approximately 1 to 2 weeks. Once you are properly acclimated you will appreciate better tactile feedback superior response times and ultimately greater control. Simply put You will become a better typist.   ...And It s Heavy   It s not just called heavyweight because it packs the best performance in the industry. The 7G is also physically heavy. All keys are mounted on a metal plate within the keyboard to ensure durability. The plastic material used to create the keyboard has metal elements also to help to improve durability.   USB and PS 2 Connectors   The PS 2 connector will give you total freedom with no limit to the amount of simultaneous key presses. And equally as important using the PS 2 may just improve your overall gaming experience. The reason is that when you use a USB keyboard your computer is actually using CPU time polling your keyboard. The higher the polling rate the more CPU time is used to perform the polling. And because of the built-in debounce rate found on any quality keyboard any polling rate above 200Hz is simply a waste of CPU time and really just a result of pointless marketing hype. Unlike USB keyboards a PS 2 keyboard isn t polled at all. The keyboard simply sends a signal to the computer as key presses are made which causes a hardware interrupt forcing the CPU to register the signal.   The 7G is built with a USB as standard but also included is a USB to PS 2 adapter in the box. The choice is yours.        Easy Access to Media Controls   The Windows key is useful for certain things and in certain situations. But not in the middle of a gaming session. Replacing it on the 7G is a SteelSeries Key that won t wreak havoc during a gaming session by minimizing your game or by opening a menu. The SteelSeries Key serves a different purpose it s a function key for the Media Controls found on the 7G. You can press the SteelSeries key and access the Media Controls via the first six F-keys on the keyboard.   What s in the Box   The SteelSeries 7G Mechanical Keyboard handrest USB connector USB to PS 2 adapter.   What Critics Are Saying About SteelSeries 7G Mechanical Keyboard ...the build quality of the 7G is nothing short of exceptional.

High-speed continuous shooting at approximately six images per second   The K-r s high-speed continuous shooting mode records as many as 25 images in JPEG recording format in a single sequence at a maximum speed of approximately six images per second fastest of all entry-class models for sharp crisp images of fast-moving subjects.    High-precision AF system   The K-r s high-precision wide-frame SAFOX IX autofocus system features 11 sensor points with nine cross-type sensors positioned in the middle for pinpoint focus on the subject. The K-r is also equipped with a spotbeam projector to assist the AF system in poorly lit locations. Accuracy and speed of contrast AF operation during Live View shooting is enhanced with a new-generation image sensor and drastic upgrading of AF algorithms.    Bright clear optical viewfinder   The Pentax-original finder optics and the renowned Natural-Bright-Matte focusing screen ensure the K-r s viewfinder offers a bright clear subject image at 0.85X magnification and with a 96 field of view. The viewfinder offers excellent visibility even in bright outdoor locations and provides delay-free real-time display of the subject s image. This is helpful when shutter release timing is critical such as in sports photography. The in-focus point is indicated as a red point in the viewfinder for at-a-glance confirmation.    Large easy-to-view 3-inch LCD monitor with wide-view design   The K-r features a large high-resolution color LCD monitor with approximately 921 000 dots and its wide-view design assures a clear view of the monitor image from approximately 170 degrees horizontally and vertically making it particularly useful in low- and high-angle applications during Live View shooting.    Versatile dual-power-source design   In addition to the rechargeable lithium-ion battery which allows the photographer to capture approximately 560 images with a single recharge the K-r can also be powered by four AA-size batteries using optional AA Battery Holder D-BH109.

Users may choose from 18 filters including a new Starburst Sketch and Posterization and may now apply filter upon filter one after another to an image for more creative results. 3 Cross Process mode with three options  The K-r features the unique Cross Process mode that automatically shifts photographic parameters for each exposure to create eye-catching images with dramatic colors as with photographs treated with the cross process in film photography . In addition to Random where the results are unpredictable until the image has been processed users now have two new options  Preset with three different sets of preset parameters and Favorite with user-input parameters. A film development technique that uses unconventional film development to create a distinctive finish with dramatic stylized colors. 4 Improved High Dynamic Range function  The K-r features the High Dynamic Range function to create one composite image with an extra-wide gradation range from three images with different exposures without a computer. Users may choose from Auto Standard and Expanded at three levels modes to accommodate different creative intentions.    Auto Align function   Allows use even with handheld shooting.    High-speed infrared data transmission system   The K-r is the first Pentax digital SLR camera equipped with the IrSimple high-speed infrared data transmission system which allows users to transfer image data to IrSimple-compatible digital devices and post their K-r images on the web via a cellular phone. This also allows users to exchange image data between two K-r cameras and play a simple match game using image Exif data such as aperture or shutter-speed values to judge images and offer techniques and suggestions for better images.    High-quality HDTV-proportion movie recording at 1280 x 720 pixels and at 25 frames per second   The K-r provides a movie-recording function which captures beautiful true-to-life movie clips in 16 9 high-definition TV proportions 1280 x 720 pixels at a frame rate of 25 frames per second. This extends many benefits of high-quality SLR photography to the world of movie shooting For example users may reduce the depth of field to make a subject stand out or use different interchangeable lenses to create distinctive visual effects. The K-r also assures a greater possibility of visual presentation in movies--either through the application of digital filters such as Toy Camera and Retro to add specific visual effects during shooting or through the use of various movie-editing functions after shooting. When the Pentax K-r s AV output terminal is used movie clips are output at normal resolution. The data must be transferred to a PC for the playback of movie clips at high-definition TV proportions 1280 x 720 pixels .

Look to a LEICA DC VARIO-SUMMICRON lens with 24mm wide-angle capability and f 2.0 aperture to bring you optical performance with exceptional precision and clarity. Then rely on a 1 1.63 CCD image sensor for 10.1-megapixel still photos that exceed higher-resolution images in purity and detail. Next adding multimedia to your outing the DMC-LX5 lets you shoot HD 720p video with expanded manual controls. Further while Power optical image stabilization ensures blur-free shots a Lithium-ion battery lets you shoot up to 400 photos on a single charge. Finally Panasonic s Intelligent Auto mode steps in and handles camera functions flawlessly when you want to focus on the fun and not on settings.,The Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX5 is a unique compact digital camera offering photo enthusiasts the ideal way for capturing professional-quality photos and High Definition HD video. With an ultra-bright F2.0 ultra-wide-angle 24mm Leica DC Vario-Summicron lens the Lumix LX5 minimizes image distortion resulting in stunning true-to-life images with outstanding resolution and detail.                    The 24mm wide angle lens offers extraordinarily large viewing space and now the optical zoom is extended to 3.8x 90mm making the LX5 even more versatile.    The F2.0 lens is twice as bright as a F2.8 lens making it easy to produce beautiful photos with a soft-focused background thanks to the shallow depth of field provided by the extra light.   In addition to the newly-designed lens the Lumix LX5 features an image processing engine that combines technologies resulting in professional-quality photos especially in low-light situations. Like its predecessor the Lumix LX5 features the highly-acclaimed 10.1-megapixel CCD but it has an expanded dynamic range by increasing the sensitivity and the saturation.     Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX5 Highlights        Venus Engine FHD image processor                               The newly developed Venus Engine FHD image processor enables higher-speed higher-performance while compiling the Intelligent Resolution technology. The triple CPUs in this imaging engine dramatically speeds up processing while achieving exceptional noise reduction performance. With its high-sensitivity CCD and the brightness of the lens minimum illumination of the Lumix LX5 is as low as 3 lux while shooting video.    The predecessor DMC-LX3 played a big role to cease the pixel count war by adopting 1 1.63-inch CCD for 10.1-megapixel recording to realize the unprecedented picture quality with a compact digital camera and even to establish a new premium compact camera category in the market. The CCD in the LX3 which was highly acclaimed from specialists worldwide is redesigned to achieve further expansion of dynamic range by increasing the sensitivity by approx. 31 and the saturation by approx.38 compared to the LX3. It is made possible by the improvement of on-tip-lens design with larger light concentration and VCCD expansion while deepening the photo diode to manage richer signal more effectively.    The result is a high resolution noise-less pictures even in high sensitivity recording and richly reproduced gradation in highly contrasted situations with the exquisitely wide dynamic range. Taking advantage of the high sensitivity CCD and the brightness of the lens minimum illumination of DMC-LX5 is as low as 3 lux in movie recording.    Record HD videos in AVCHD Lite                              In addition to Motion JPEG images the DMC-LX5 can record high-definition motion picture in AVCHD Lite. It features almost doubling the recording time in HD quality compared with the conventional Motion JPEG format. The picture quality is greatly enhanced thanks to the newly added Intelligent Resolution technology.   The LX5 also features Dolby Digital Creator to record high quality audio.    In movie recording the DMC-LX5 goes further than simply recording HD movies. Apart from the movie recording capability of conventional digital compact cameras the DMC-LX5 also features a Creative Movie mode which lets the user set the shutter speed and aperture manually to make even more impressive movies. Changing the shutter speed brings special effects to movies which is especially suitable for shooting fast-moving subject. The ability to control the aperture is convenient when there are several subjects at different distances and it is desired to have each of them stand out. My Color mode is also available in movie recording.    Ergonomic design for easy control   The Lumix LX5 has also been redesigned externally--with a thicker grip making it easier to hold and a newly-incorporated turn-and-push jog dial achieves various selection and setting more quickly. The Lumix LX5 also features a hot shoe which allows for the attachment of a wide-variety of accessories such as an optional Live View Finder which helps shooting under strong daylight with high visibility or an external flash. The 1 1 square format setting is added in the aspect ratio option which can be selected with the switch at the side of the lens barrel.    Additional Features                               The 3.0-inch large 460 000-dot high resolution Intelligent LCD also redesigned by adopting High CRI Color Rendering Index backlight LED to greatly increase the color reproduction making it more visible both in shooting and playing back images in any conditions from at dark night to under bright sunlight.

Unique Hybrid Technology   Ovi Maps is built on an advanced technology called hybrid vector maps. Vector maps are high quality but less data intensive and allow you to continue to navigate even if you lose your network connection. This means that maps downloaded or updated across a network connection are about half the size of bulky bitmaps used by other mobile map providers. The hybrid technology ensures that unlike other providers any downloaded map data is stored on the device for future use.   No Network Connection Required When Navigating   Avoid expensive battery-draining network connections with Nokia s unique hybrid technology. Maps can be pre-loaded on to your Nokia smartphone so you can set Ovi Maps to offline mode saving battery power and the navigation system will still work. This is particularly useful for those worried about data connection costs when travelling abroad or when you are travelling through areas with little or no network coverage.   Best Global Coverage   You take your mobile with you wherever you go in the world so as standard voice guided navigation for both pedestrians and drivers is available for 74 countries in 46 different languages and there are maps for over 180 countries.

I wasn t expecting to be blown away but I have been pleasantly surprised with this laptop.   First of all it looks great. The glowing HP logo is reminiscent of the glowing Apple logo and the brushed metal-type backing just makes it look that much better. The keyboard and the surroundings are very clean no additional unnecessary buttons and the keyboard is solid and easy to type on. The trackpad has multifinger functionality for scrolling pinching and rotating. At first the trackpad was hard to scroll on as my fingers did not glide but eventually it broke in and it was easier.  In terms of previous reviews saying that the software is terrible that must be an exception. This was a rare time for me to find a laptop with such little bloatware -- just Office and some HP games at most. Usually I do a clean install of Windows when I buy a new computer but with this one it was unnecessary. The i5 processor is very speedy does not heat up a lot and the fan is relatively quiet. The battery is also decent going around 5-6 hours on regular use.  Overall I think this is a great purchase for someone who would like a decent sturdy laptop for an affordable price and would enjoy telling their MacBook Pro friends how they paid 1000 less for a PC with better components Help other customers find the most helpful reviews Was this review helpful to you Yes      No                   Report abuse Permalink       Comment Comments 3 6 of 6 people found the following review helpful 5.0 out of 5 stars       A Great Deal  July 30 2011        By Real food matters Pleasanton CA -  See all my reviews            This review is from HP Pavilion dm4-2070us Intel Core i5-2410M 14.0-Inch Notebook PC Steel Gray Aluminum  Personal Computers I got this laptop for college- it was the best deal I found for a laptop with equivalent specs. I love it it is sturdy the hinges don t wobble at all something that endlessly bugged me with my last laptop and is surprisingly light. the finger scanner feature took me a day or two to get used to but once I got the hang of it it turned out to be really convenient. the processor is fast and the keyboard doesn t have any annoying quirks- like mushy keys. I hate mushy keys . The laptop looks and works exactly as I had hoped and I am not disappointed with anything I must mention that I have read reviews on Amazon and other websites that mention how frustrating the software can be on HPs. I have not experienced any issues relating to the version of OS HP installed. Then again when I first got my laptop I had to delete a LOT of bloatware and I also installed open source alternatives to most of the regular Windows software at the time not for any particular reason other than I am more familiar with the open source programs .   This laptop is perfect for college but it is powerful and small enough to be a great personal laptop too- I am very glad I bought it Help other customers find the most helpful reviews Was this review helpful to you Yes      No                   Report abuse Permalink       Comment Comment                   5 of 5 people found the following review helpful 5.0 out of 5 stars       Great laptop timely delivery July 31 2011        By ManliusSanta   -  See all my reviews            Amazon Verified Purchase What s this  This review is from HP Pavilion dm4-2070us Intel Core i5-2410M 14.0-Inch Notebook PC Steel Gray Aluminum  Personal Computers Got this laptop through Back2School Electronics. The order was processed and delivered quickly. Even though the seller did not send an email update when the order was shipped the order arrived promptly and everything was fine.   Laptop fired up quickly and performed well. Tested the wifi connection used internet from several locations and the connection was very good. The laptop did not drop the connection any time this was mentioned by another reviewer as a potential problem . There is no instruction on how to use the fingerprint reader probably there is something somewhere on an online manual yet to find it . Also worked the dvd player with a CD. Playback and sound quality are very good.  Over 3 hours of almost continuous use the laptop remained very cool. In fact the fan did not come on for most part. The laptop is very quiet and great to use during late evening The disk action LED is on the left side -- not very visible when you are using the laptop -- so it is hard to know whether the laptop is doing any disk access unless you turn laptop and look to left side. Key integrated indicator LEDs for wifi and speaker are great. Laptop was surprisingly light weight. Also the charger was very light when compared to my 5-year old compaq laptop and its bulky charger .   I am very happy with the laptop. Also will recommend purchase from this seller.

A lot of thought went into creating an iPod nano that not only talks but says the right things. It all begins with iTunes and its seamless integration with iPod nano. First iTunes reads your song information then uses the VoiceOver Kit to generate the announcements for the songs artists and playlists. Just sync your iPod nano to your computer and it really speaks to you.    It Speaks Multiple Languages   Your music library has songs from all over the world--a love song from France a bolero from Spain a pop tune from Japan. Luckily VoiceOver speaks fluent song.   iTunes selects the language and best voice for your song titles and artist names. It looks at song data like the title artist and album information then applies intelligent algorithms to choose the right language. For example iTunes recognizes the song Ya Viene el Sol by Ozomatli as a Spanish song so your iPod nano will automatically speak that song title and artist in Spanish. If you prefer to hear that information spoken in another language you can change the designated VoiceOver language for that song in iTunes.   Hit the Ground Running--Or Walking  With the Nike iPod Sport Kit sold separately and a built-in pedometer to help keep you motivated and track your fitness progress iPod nano makes working out less routine.   Step it up with the New Pedometer   You take your iPod nano with you everywhere. Why not use it to stay fit iPod nano now doubles as a Pedometer.

You can create a daily step goal or set it to Always On so it counts all the steps you take all the time. Which makes iPod nano the ideal exercise partner.    Rock and Run   Your shoes and your iPod nano team up to maximize your run. See the minutes tick by. Watch the miles unfold. Hear real-time voice feedback. All to your favorite music including your chosen Power Song--that one song that always gets you through the home stretch.    Rock the Gym   Take Nike iPod to the gym and minute by minute mile by mile you re motivated by more than music. Connect your iPod nano to a Nike iPod compatible cardio machine. Record your pace time and distance as you work out. With iPod nano every trip to the gym becomes a new challenge.    Sync   When you re finished connect your iPod nano to your Mac or PC. iTunes automatically sends your workout data to nikeplus.com. Every workout and every run is there ready for you to review. Get pumped for your next run with recommended challenges custom training programs and maps of new routes to try. Or share motivation with runners across the world.

Humminbird Side Imaging Sonar uses a razor thin beam to take a sonar snapshot of the area up to 240 ft. to the left and right of your location. The return image for this slice is then added to the images taken immediately before and after to build an incredibly detailed view of the lake bottom.   Down Imaging   Humminbird has pointed their Side Imaging technology in a new direction straight down. Now you can see the detail of what is happening below your boat. Timber brush bridge pilings rocks and any other structure will pop with stunning detail as you patrol the water. Take a peek you ll like what you see.   DualBeam Plus   Get the best of both worlds with selectable narrow and wide beams you can view individually or melded into one display.

You can view the two beams separately side by side or blended together for the most complete picture.   Switchfire Sonar   When you hit the water you don t limit yourself to one bait. So why limit your sonar Exclusive Humminbird SwitchFire Sonar gives you the power to choose how returns are displayed. With two unique modes you have complete control to adjust with the fishing conditions making our down-looking sonar an even more valuable fishfinding tool.

Snapshots are like a digital picture of the screen and can be saved anytime you mark a hotspot.   Split Screen Zoom   Split Screen Zoom increases the displayed resolution to separate sonar returns that are very close together. In this view the display is split to show a narrow slice of the full range view on the right and the zoomed view on the left. The zoom preview box on the right tracks the bottom in the full range view.   Freeze Frame Structure Marking   Pressing any arrow on the four-way cursor control instantly stops the sonar graphic display to allow a closer inspection of submerged structure bait fish and underwater contours. Movable cursor feature allows you to instantly discern depth of any sonar return and mark waypoints from the sonar screen for navigation. Pressing the EXIT key will exit the freeze frame and the display will start to resume scrolling. Mark the location of fish-attracting structure bottom transitions or any feature anywhere on traditional sonar with the Sonar Cursor.   Selective Fish ID Fish ID uses advanced sonar processing to interpret sonar returns and displays a Fish Symbol when very selective requirements are met. When a fish is detected a fish icon and its depth are displayed above the return that has been classified as being a fish. Three different fish icons represent intensity of the sonar return and provide an indicator of relative fish size.   Real Time Sonar RTS Window   A Real Time Sonar RTS Window appears on the right side of the display in the Sonar View only. The RTS Window always updates at the fastest rate possible and shows only the returns from the bottom structure and fish that are within the transducer beam. The RTS window can be displayed as narrow standard wide or off.   Sonar Echo Enhancement   Sonar Echo Enhancement shows fish bait and more--even watch your vertical jigging on-screen. This is possible through advanced sonar processing and provides the details you want and need. It s important to know what depth the fish are located and equally important to be able to place your lure at that precise depth. Be careful You may jerk the rod early while watching the screen instead of waiting for the actual bite.   TreuArch Technology   Many competitive sonar products commonly use post processing software to enhance the arching effect produced when suspended targets enter and leave a sonar beam. This additional processing can slow down performance and exaggerate the information displayed. Humminbird s TrueArch Technology utilizes parallel processing of sonar data to eliminate unwanted interference and noise and reveal unaltered sonar echoes resulting in true arches of fish targets. This helps anglers more quickly discern the size and depth of fish targets.   Built-In U.S. ContourXD Maps   Humminbird has upgraded the free built-in cartography software on the 900 series Combo models. All-new ContourXD by Navionics is an enhanced professional mapping package. With over 3 000 U.S. lake maps in the database you will be able to find a lake close to any location you might want to wet a line. As an added bonus ContourXD maps will feature depth contour lines so you can find all the drops bumps and channels holding fish. The maps will also include U.S. lights markers and major roads and interstates. Fish like a pro on your home lake or a lake far from home thanks to Humminbird ContourXD.

Enjoy Full HD 1080 60i movies 2 astounding low-light pictures continuous shooting up to 7 fps incredible panorama shots and Live View on a tilting 3.0-inch6 LCD.,The NEX-5 has all picture quality of a DSLR yet it s about half the size half the weight and far less complex. Pulling off this minor miracle took some clever innovations in glass silicon and software code.    Sony Alpha NEX-5 Overview     Bigger Sensor Better Pictures                       In technical terms the APS-C image sensor is 13 times the size of the typical sensor. In human terms you ll be taking photographs not snapshots. The bigger sensor means softer backgrounds for more attractive portraits.    The NEX-5 is equipped with a powerful new 14.2-megapixel Exmor APS HD CMOS sensor specially tuned to deliver uncompromising still-photo and movie image quality. Equal in surface area and performance to the large APS-C image sensors used in Sony s acclaimed a system digital SLR cameras it offers exceptionally rich tonal gradation and true-to-life color. Proprietary Sony processing technologies are also incorporated directly into the sensor assuring clean low-noise signal output and ultra high-speed data transfer.      World s Smallest and Lightest                      The NEX-5 delivers the quality of a DSLR in a camera that s ready to go wherever you go. In fact this is the world s smallest lightest interchangeable lens digital camera as of April 2010 . It s roughly half the size and weight of Sony s smallest lightest DSLR the a230.    Equipped with an image sensor that s 13 times the size of the typical compact camera s sensor a NEX cameras turn snapshots into photographs. The bigger sensor means images with softer background that make your subject stand out and stunning low-light shots.     Expect More from a Camera   Sony has always recognized that a digital camera could take pictures in ways that film cameras never dreamed of. That s why we ve created new capabilities to take your photography further than ever. These include Sweep Panorama Auto HDR Handheld Twilight and Anti Motion Blur modes.    Thanks to their powerful Exmor CMOS image sensor and BIONZ image processing engine both these cameras can offer high-speed continuous shooting at up to 7 fps approx. in Speed Priority Continuous mode and at up to 2.3 fps approx. in Continuous Advance mode. In addition their 10-second self-timer also has a 3-shot continuous shooting setting.     High Def Not Half Def                      Many cameras take HD movies but not so many offer the same Full HD 1080-line resolution as most broadcast HD networks. And very few have the same 60i frame rate for fluid natural motion. In fact this is the world s first interchangeable lens digital still camera with 1080 60i HD movies1.    When you re shooting movies in AF mode with an E-mount lens the camera smoothly adjusts focus and exposure in response to changes in the scene and you can use the control wheel to instantly adjust exposure compensation on the fly. If desired you can also preselect white balance and Creative Style settings before movie recording begins.    The Creativity of Changing Lenses   The beauty of SLR photography is the ability to change lenses to match your shooting situation. Now Sony brings that beauty to a compact camera. The NEX-5 gives you a choice of dedicated E-mount lenses plus a choice of 28 A-mount lenses via an adaptor sold separately.     Sophistication Made Simple                      Some cameras bristle with knobs buttons and dials. The NEX-5 replaces them with a simple turn-and-click Control Wheel and a pair of Soft Keys. These give you easy access to the full power of digital photography. To make learning even easier Sony includes an On-Screen Help Guide and On-Screen Tips.    Automatically apply exposure values and Scene Selection modes that are optimized to suit each scene. What s more they combine this full-auto convenience with a Background Defocus Control function that lets you enjoy one of the biggest creative advantages of interchangeable lens photography--the ability to defocus the background to make your main subject stand out from the scene. Just press and rotate the control wheel to set the level of background defocusing you want--it s easy and intuitive because you can confirm the level of defocusing on the LCD monitor in real-time.    The main menu features six clearly labeled icons that can be selected simply by rotating and pressing the control wheel. Inside standard scrolling menus provide quick access to settings for shooting and playback functions as well as a host of other user preferences and camera settings. The wide-screen format of the LCD monitor also contributes to enhanced menu legibility so text and icons are always easy to see and select.,8.7 x 5.8 x 4.7 inches,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-zqP-tIPL._SL500_AA300_.jpg,2.2 pounds,3 pounds,,"<ul><li>The quality of a DSLR in about half the size, weight</li> <li>World's smallest, lightest interchangeable lens camera</li> <li>Same APS-C sensor size, same resolution as Alpha DSLRs</li> <li>14.2 MP; up to 7 fps shooting; ISO 12800 sensitivity</li> <li>World's first in class1 with 1080/60i Full HD movies</li> </ul>"

Eye-catching new design improves ergonomics of the leg angle levers and the horizontal column block. Leg angle presets increase the tripod s stability in bad weather conditions or on uneven terrain. Quick action leg locks with new improved design. Built-in bubble spirit level makes camera alig nment quick and easy Centre column can be quickly and easily swung from vertical to horizontal without any disassembly.,Newly redesigned the 190XPROB makes the famous Manfrotto-patented horizontal center column feature even easier to use. Now by extending the column to its highest vertical position it can be swung around to horizontal without removing the head or disassembling the column itself so switching between framing and positioning setups is more convenient than ever. The ergonomics of the leg angle release mechanism and the quick action leg locks themselves have also been greatly improved.,The Manfrotto 190XPROB three-section tripod is ultra stable flexible and easy to use making it a great choice for professional photographers everywhere. The tripod is distinguished by its Manfrotto-patented horizontal center column which has been completely redesigned to create a more user-friendly feel. By extending the column to its highest vertical position users can now swing the tripod round to horizontal without removing the head or disassembling the column itself. This makes switching between framing and positioning setups more convenient than ever. In addition Manfrotto improved the ergonomics of the leg angle release mechanism and the quick-action leg locks making it a breeze to open position and close the tripod in just a few seconds. The tension of the locking mechanism is even user-adjustable so you can find the right tension for your comfort level.   The tripod s unique design allows the photographer to use the center column horizontally as an extending arm or vertically both right-way-up and upside-down . When used horizontally the center column can be turned 360 degrees around the tripod making it useful for macro work low-angle shooting extreme balance points and off-center work. This also makes the tripod a helpful accessory for chair-bound photographers who can sit beside the tripod instead of behind it putting them much closer to the camera viewfinder.    Should you need to balance the tripod on an uneven surface you can set each of the legs to a different spread angle over the tripod s center of gravity--a must for nature shots on outdoor terrain. This also allows you to adjust the tripod to several different heights with four preset independent leg angles and a spring-loaded step mechanism for extra stability.

Or add Nike shoes and a Nike iPod Sport Kit for the perfect workout partner.            How it Works   You ll notice how smoothly and easily VoiceOver works. A lot of thought went into creating an iPod nano that not only talks but says the right things. It all begins with iTunes and its seamless integration with iPod nano. First iTunes reads your song information then uses the VoiceOver Kit to generate the announcements for the songs artists and playlists. Just sync your iPod nano to your computer and it really speaks to you.    It Speaks Multiple Languages   Your music library has songs from all over the world--a love song from France a bolero from Spain a pop tune from Japan. Luckily VoiceOver speaks fluent song.   iTunes selects the language and best voice for your song titles and artist names. It looks at song data like the title artist and album information then applies intelligent algorithms to choose the right language. For example iTunes recognizes the song Ya Viene el Sol by Ozomatli as a Spanish song so your iPod nano will automatically speak that song title and artist in Spanish. If you prefer to hear that information spoken in another language you can change the designated VoiceOver language for that song in iTunes.     Hit the Ground Running--Or Walking    With the Nike iPod Sport Kit sold separately and a built-in pedometer to help keep you motivated and track your fitness progress iPod nano makes working out less routine.    Step it up with the New Pedometer   You take your iPod nano with you everywhere. Why not use it to stay fit iPod nano now doubles as a Pedometer. It uses the built-in accelerometer to keep track of your steps and help you meet your fitness goals. You can create a daily step goal or set it to Always On so it counts all the steps you take all the time. Which makes iPod nano the ideal exercise partner.    Rock and Run   Your shoes and your iPod nano team up to maximize your run. See the minutes tick by. Watch the miles unfold. Hear real-time voice feedback. All to your favorite music including your chosen Power Song--that one song that always gets you through the home stretch.    Rock the Gym   Take Nike iPod to the gym and minute by minute mile by mile you re motivated by more than music. Connect your iPod nano to a Nike iPod compatible cardio machine. Record your pace time and distance as you work out. With iPod nano every trip to the gym becomes a new challenge.    Sync   When you re finished connect your iPod nano to your Mac or PC. iTunes automatically sends your workout data to nikeplus.com. Every workout and every run is there ready for you to review. Get pumped for your next run with recommended challenges custom training programs and maps of new routes to try. Or share motivation with runners across the world.     Note to Self Voice Memos Are Here    The built-in mic lets you capture a thought a reminder a class lecture or any audio recording you want with Voice Memos.     iTunes Your Greatest Hits    It s even easier to organize browse grow and share your digital music and video collection with the new iTunes.
