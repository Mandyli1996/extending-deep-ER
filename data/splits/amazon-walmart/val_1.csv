Ideal for general purpose recording a single TDK DVD-R has ample capacity for thousands of digital photos up to six hours of video and behemoth mission-critical data files. Each DVD-R disc can be fully recorded once. As DVD recording speeds have increased the importance of using name brand quality media has become paramount. When a DVD-R is recorded at high speeds the fast RPM s of the recording process require an advanced ultra-sensitive recording material capable of compensating for the abbreviated exposure to the drive laser. Specially formulated with a rapid phase-change recording layer TDK DEV-R media products maximize the data transfer rate while minimizing the potential for errors. The discs have been thoroughly tested and verified to outperform other media brands which may rely on slow-reacting error-prone phase-change materials. TDK AVIST metallic alloys change between crystalline and amorphous states in response to the heat generated by a laster for phase-change recording. The differences in relectivity exhibited by the alloy in its cystalline and amorphous states are read as data. TDK AVIST alloys are designed for the most precise laser response resulting in perfect data marks and superior recording and playback performance.,5.5 x 5.0 x 4.5 inches,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514LWAShgaL._SL500_AA300_.jpg,2.1 pounds,3 pounds,,<ul><li>Write once DVD-R</li> <li>Record at speeds up to 16x</li> <li>Each disc can hold 4.7GB or 120min of video recordings</li> <li>These discs are formatted for DVD-R/RW burners</li> <li>These 50 DVD-R discs come on a spindle for storage</li> </ul>

To help you get a great 3D experience use our checklist below to ensure that you have everything you need. If you have any questions or want to learn more about 3D we invite you to visit  3D 101 --our center for everything 3D. To get started with 3D please ensure that you have A Display  The first--and most important--item you ll need is a 3D-ready display--whether it be a 3D HDTV 3D projector or 3D computer monitor. These displays usually have a higher processing power than older models as they need to display one image for each eye to create a 3D effect.                       A Source  While your display is ready for 3D playback you still need a device to read 3D content i.e. a movie or a show . This source can be a cable box with a subscription to a 3D channel a 3D Blu-ray Disc player or a PlayStation 3.                      Content  In order to watch 3D you will need to get some 3D content. This 3D content will come from the source mentioned above in the form of a 3D program movie or game. Please ensure that your 3D movies are in the Blu-ray 3D format as this new format will provide the best 3D experience.                      3D Glasses  All 3D HDTVs on the market require Active Shutter glasses to create the 3D effect. You will need to buy one pair of glasses for each viewer. Also make sure that the Active Shutter glasses you buy are compatible with your display--for example buy the glasses from the same brand as your 3D HDTV.                       HDMI Cable  To connect your source such as a 3D Blu-ray Disc player to your display you ll need a hgh-speed HDMI cable. Cables with this designation--with bandwidth speeds up to 10.2 Gbps gigabits per second --will be able to carry the 3D signal without any loss of quality.

Furthermore the Ikari Laser is completely driverless which enables the mouse to remember settings and macros when plugged into tournament computers. The advanced SteelSeries XY2 laser engine supports resolution settings with increments of only one CPI which for the first time ever enables the user to fine tune the mouse to his personal reaction pattern. The gaming grade engine used in the SteelSeries Ikari Laser utilizes a new way of analyzing tracking reaching 40.000 SPS or around five times the speed of conventional laser technology .,The SteelSeries Ikari mice are the result of 15 months of extensive research in ergonomics technology shape motion hand grip and play styles by gamers. The shape materials and specifications of the SteelSeries Ikari mice are based on input from professional players from Team 3D compLexity mousesports SK Gaming Team NoA and other world-class gaming organizations who collectively represent the world s most accomplished gamers in Counter-Strike and other gaming disciplines.      LCD display allows gamers to quickly and easily adjust their settings.  View larger     Easily toggle between two sensitivity settings for maximum performance.  View larger     Large glide pads underneath the mouse give it a smooth and fluent glide on any surface        Plug and play perfect for travel or when using multiple platforms or computers    With FreeMove your mouse will move on the screen exactly as you move it on the surface    Anti-tangle braided cord for enhanced durability     LCD Display   The LCD display on the Ikari Laser allows gamers to quickly and easily adjust their settings. This is a winning feature especially if you attend LAN parties or use your mouse on different software and hardware platforms.   XY2 Laser   The advanced XY2 laser engine inside the Ikari laser makes this a perfect mouse for FPS gaming at the highest level. This laser is faster and more precise. It can reach 40 000 SPS Samples Per Second which is about five times faster than conventional laser technology.   Toggle On-the-Fly Sensitivity   With Toggle On-the-fly the Ikari introduces an option for gamers to have two different sensitivity settings and switch between them with only one button click below the scroll wheel on the mouse. This allows you to switch your sensitivity settings quickly whether it s for different weapon types in FPS games or in player vs. player action for MMORPG games.   Programmable Macros   The Ikari Laser has a programmable macro setup and a feature option for RTS and MMORPG gaming. Its intuitive button layout makes life easy for gamers who have the need for fast and multiple macro use.   SteelSeries FreeMove   SteelSeries FreeMove gives you the option to remove interpolation of the mouse. Conventional mouse settings help you move your cursor or pointer in a straight line but this so-called help often makes you lose accuracy. By enabling FreeMove your mouse will move on the screen exactly as you move it on the surface.   SteelSeries ExactSens   SteelSeries ExactSens provides you with settings for precise sensitivity. On a traditional mouse for example a sensitivity of 1.7 means that you multiply your physical movement on the surface by 1.7 on the screen. This makes cursor movement less predictable and inaccurate. ExactSens provides you with sensitivity control allowing you to change settings from 1-3200 CPI in increments of 1.   Large Glide Surface for Maximum Control   The large glide pads underneath the mouse give it a smooth and fluent glide on any surface. This provides extra stability and reduces friction for maximum control. The glides are interchangeable and changing them out regularly with SteelSeries Glides will ensure your product remains in peak performance.   Plug and Play Operation   There are no external drivers needed to configure your settings for the Ikari Laser. All you need is in the mouse itself which makes it perfect for travel and when using multiple platforms or computers.   Braided Cord for Durability   The 6.5-foot 2-meter mouse cable is an anti-tangle braided cord for enhanced durability. The gold-plated USB 2.0 connector resists corrosion and ensures no loss in signal transfer so every movement remains precise.   What s in the Box   SteelSeries Ikari High Performance Laser Gaming Mouse and software.

Custom Multi-band Selectable Display can be set so that each Band alert can be a different color,Whistler s Pro-Series Line Can Whistler improve for 2009 YES Our new SE versions of our high performance units include a feature called Ka Max mode. This feature improves on our already impressive Ka perfromance. All the SE models include our popular features - Radar Signal ID RSID and Laser Signal ID LSID .,Whistler s XTR-695 is a detector that maximizes sensitivity and minimizes falsing. Ka Max Mode gives you improved Ka Band sensitivity. Radar Signature ID displays known Ka gun frequencies to help distinguish threats and Laser Signature ID does the same by displaying pulses per second of received laser signals. Take advantage of 360-degree coverage for all radar and laser bands Whistler s patented POP-mode detection and a wealth of bonus features like a 72-point digital compass and vehicle battery voltmeter.                The XTR-695 maximizes sensitivity and minimizes falsing.  Click to enlarge.             7 Color Backlit LCD Text Display   The XTR-695 s brilliant text display provides distinct visual confirmation of signals detected signal strength and indicates engaged modes of operation. You can choose from 7 different display colors for a bit of personalization even assigning a different color for each band or scrolling colors.    Filter Mode   There are times when a radar detector can emit the same frequency as police radar and can cause your detector to falsely alarm. Sometimes a detector can display a signal when picking up another radar detector in vehicle close by. The Whistler Filter Mode checks the signal to verify if it s a legitimate police radar or a false alert from another detector.    Auto Dim Mode   The Auto Dim feature automatically switches the illumination of the text display between the bright and dim settings according to varying light conditions so that the text display will always be easy to read.    INTELLICORD Ready   Add the Whistler INTELLICORD and you ll be able to remotely control the radar detector in settings such as power on off city modes dim dark and quiet auto quiet with a simple press of a button.    Real Voice Alerts               Real Voice provides added information to the detected signal over and above the simple band ID tones from internal speaker.  Click to enlarge.                   7 different display colors.  Click to enlarge.            Real Voice provides added information to the detected signal over and above the simple band ID tones. The unit says X band when it detects an X band signal. This allows you to keep your eyes on-the-road. Real Voice is also used to articulate Safety Warning System messages and feature selections. Real Voice will be used to articulate the following Band Identification    Safety Warning System messages    Feature Selection      Low Profile Alert Periscopes   Whistler s Low Profile Alert Periscopes provide an added attention getting visual alert. The two extra LEDs flash on and off when the unit alarms to provide a unique visual alert.    3 City Modes Highway Mode   Highway mode provides full audio and visual warning of laser radar systems while maintaining full sensitivity. Highway mode is the default setting of all Whistler s laser radar detectors. City mode helps reduce the annoyance of automatic door openers and burglar alarm alerts by providing an initial alert same distance as Highway Mode then remaining quiet unless the signal strength becomes very strong. When the signal increases the unit will alert briefly to notify you of the change in signal strength.    Stay Alert   The Stay Alert feature is designed to test a driver s alertness. Within 30 to 60 seconds after the feature is engaged an alert is sounded to show alertness the driver must press the volume city or the mute button within 3-5 seconds. If a button is pressed within 3-5 seconds the cycle is repeated. If a button was not pressed within 3-5 seconds the unit alarms at full volume and the display shows an unique visual alert.    Quiet Auto Quiet Modes   Pressing QUIET before a signal is detected engages Auto Quiet Mode which automatically reduces the audio level after the initial warning to a low audio level setting. Pressing QUIET during a radar laser encounter silences audio alerts while allowing visual alerts to keep you informed.    Alert Priority   When two or more signals are received at the same time the alert priority is Laser VG-2 Speed Radar Safety Radar.   Example If X band is alerting then suddenly a VG-2 signal is detected the VG-2 warning will override the X band alert.    Vehicle Battery Saver Mode   The Vehicle Battery Saver Mode automatically shuts off your detector within 3 hours if you forget to turn it off. The timer is reset if the detector is turned off unplugged or any button is pressed before the 6 hours have expired. The detector will alert you with an audible and visual warning before it shuts off.    Safety Warning System--SWS   This relatively new radar is not for speed detection at all it is used to keep you informed of highway safety. Transmitters are installed and programmed for example in emergency vehicles to make you aware of possible situations that may require your attention such as ambulance vehicles that are moving or stationary road hazards ahead road construction delays or detours etc.    What s in the Box      Whistler XTR-695 Power Cord Windshield Mount User s Manual,4.7 x 3.0 x 1.4 inches,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21AHafT2GvL._SL500_AA300_.jpg,6.6 ounces,1 pounds,,"<ul><li>Indicates Ka 33.8, 34.0, 34.3, 34.7 or 35.5 on the display when police radar alerts are detected within these common Ka speed radar windows</li> <li>Laser Identifier may indicate the Pulses Per Second (PPS) transmitted by Speed Laser or other forms of laser sources.</li> <li>Custom Multi-band Selectable Display can be set so that each Band alert can be a different color</li> </ul>"

Zuiko 14 42mm zoom,The new PEN like the E-P1 is the world s smallest 12.3-megapixel interchangeable lens system with In-body Image Stabilization. It blends the high-quality still images like that of a DSLR with High Definition HD video stereo Linear PCM audio recording and In-Camera Creativity inside an ultra-portable body. Along with several new features and eight in-camera Art Filters that can be applied to still images and HD videos the result is mighty powerful and creative.                         The innovative E-P2 offers more of what photo enthusiasts have been asking for A stylish retro black metal body reminiscent of a traditional PEN camera Accessory port to accommodate the included detachable VF-2 Electronic View Finder EVF or optional external microphone adapter EMA-1 A newly-developed Continuous Autofocus C-AF Tracking System tracks the subject across or back-and-forward through the frame Two new art filters Diorama amp Cross Process for greater creative expression in your still images and HD videos iEnhance to automatically adjust color and contrast for a more dramatic effect Full Manual Control of shutter aperture in Movie Mode and   HDMI Control of camera s playback functions using the TV Remote when the camera is connected to an HDTV.      Olympus PEN E-P2 Highlights     Accessorize Everything Goes with Basic Black   The E-P2 incorporates a new port for connecting new accessories including an optional EMA-1 Microphone adapter and the VF-2 live-finder a detachable electronic viewfinder that comes with the E-P2. The live-finder easily slides onto the camera s accessory port and hot shoe when needed to provide 1.15x magnification a 100 field of view with amazing resolution brightness and contrast. The viewfinder refreshes quickly to minimize image ghosting on fast-moving subjects.    The VF-2 rotates up to 90 degrees to enable photographers to look down into it which is useful when shooting subjects from challenging angles. The built-in diopter adjustment and high magnification offer easy viewing with and without glasses.    For those who want to capture enhanced audio the new EMA-1 external microphone connector can be plugged into the new camera s external accessory port. The connector will accept the optional Olympus ME-51S stereo microphone or any microphone of their choice. Olympus has a variety of other accessories to maximize the functionality of the new PEN including the previously released 14-42mm and 17mm Micro Four Thirds lenses. The MMF-1 Four Thirds System Lens Adapter makes E-P2 compatible with all Olympus ZUIKO Digital SpecificTM lenses and other Four Thirds System lenses from Sigma Panasonic and Leica. Olympus OM film-based lenses can be attached to the E-P2 with the MF-2 OM Lens Adapter. Additionally an optional FL-14 flash unit suitably small for the camera adds more lighting versatility to your shots.               The E-P2 with optional EMA-1 microphone adapter        Stay focused on Your Targets Wherever They Roam   Sometimes it can be hard enough to keep up with kids let alone take pictures of them. The E-P2 s new C-AF Tracking and AF Target Registration locks your subject into focus and constantly adjusts focus and brightness whether you or your subject is moving. With this mode a simple push of the shutter release enables you to keep fast-moving and unpredictable subjects in focus--tracking subjects from left to right and from front to back--within the frame automatically ensuring that even active subjects are captured clearly.    Even More Ways to Create   Olympus pioneered easy-to-use in-camera art filters for still images captured inside its E-System DSLRs. It was the first company to offer the ability to apply art filters to High Definition video recordings captured with the E-P1. Now the E-P2 continues this tradition of innovation with eight in-camera art filters including two new filters the Diorama and Cross Process. The Diorama art filter gives users a miniature model photo feeling by narrowing the depth of focus and enhancing color and contrast. The selective focus that this filter offers lends intimacy to images of even the largest subjects like canyons or cityscapes.    The Cross Process art filter offers an unexpected look to images and videos by changing the color and contrast of subjects on the fly. Using this mode can result in surreal other-worldly images. Whether you re a videographer documentarian or established director--or just want to shoot like one --Art Filters set your images and videos apart from the pack. Since they re built into the camera you can achieve dramatic results on the go without needing a computer or editing software. These new filters are a welcome addition to the Pop Art Soft Focus Pale amp Light Color Light Tone Grainy Film and Pin Hole filters previously available on the E-P1.    Because the PEN is an interchangable lens system camera you also have more creative options for video capture. You can attach any one of the new super-compact Micro Four Thirds lenses or because the camera can accept many of the other Four Thirds Format lenses with an available MMF-1 Four Thirds System Lens Adapter you can add anything from an extreme wide-angle fisheye lens to a super telephoto lens for a wide range of expressive options. All the while you will have more DSLR-like control over depth of field focus white balance and ISO. It begs the question  What will you create iEnhance for Radiant Colors   The E-P2 includes a new picture mode called iEnhance which analyzes colors and brightness. The new mode mimics what the naked eye sees. For example a beautiful sunset looks awesome in person and generally seems to fade when captured in an image. With iEnhance the warm yellow and orange colors are heightened to be brilliant and closer to the actual scene. The result is exceptionally clear imaging with a dramatically lifelike color. iEnhance can be used in any shooting mode--from program to manual--and automatically engages when in iAuto.    HDMI Control from Your HDTV Remote   The new PEN makes sharing your content easier than ever. Just connect the E-P2 to your HDTV with an optional HDMI cable and use your HDTV s remote to control playback functions and navigate the camera s menus from the comfort of your favorite couch or chair.    Manual in Movie Mode   The E-P2 s manual movie mode allows for independent control of aperture and shutter for expanded exposure and creative control. Now you can adjust the shutter to control the depth of focus while using the aperture to set the overall brightness of the video. This level of control allows you to express your vision exactly how you want in your HD videos.    Make a Design Statement   The E-P2 s high-end stainless-steel all-black body is easy to handle and carry and has the styling and refinement of a precision chronometer. Its retro-chic look turns heads from tech-aficionados and camera buffs to the style-conscious and everyday point-and-shooter. Built rock solid it fits comfortably in a jacket pocket or a handbag for impromptu street-shooting or any spontaneous adventure. The E-P2 lets you do more and go more places while capturing your life thanks to its compact size--4.74 W x 2.75  H x 1.37  D --and light 11.1-ounce body. Attention to detail is visible in every aspect of the PEN s design including the currently available small and lightweight 14-42mm and 17mm M. Zuiko Digital lenses as well as the newly announced 9-18mm f4.0-5.6 18-36mm equivalent and 14-150mm f4.0-5.6 28-300mm equivalent M. Zuiko Digital lenses.    Ultra-Compact Body Delivers Superior Image Quality   The E-P2 has everything you need to produce vibrant DSLR-quality images a large 12.3-megapixel imager In-body Image Stabilization fast Imager Autofocus the proven Olympus Dust Reduction System and the new TruePic V Image Processor.               Standard point-and-shoot sensor vs. the PEN E-P2 sensor        As the second Micro Four Thirds camera from Olympus the E-P2 provides the same image quality as current Four Thirds format E-System cameras because it has the same image sensor size as the E-30 and E-620 DSLR models but in a much smaller body. This high-performance 12.3-megapixel Live MOS image sensor delivers excellent dynamic range accurate color fidelity and a state-of-the-art amplifier circuit to reduce noise and capture fine image details in both highlight and shadow areas.    The E-P2 s Live MOS image sensor is complemented by Olympus TruePic V Image Processor which produces clear and colorful photos using all the pixel information for each image to provide the best digital images possible. The image processor is noted for accurate natural color true-to-life flesh tones brilliant blue skies and precise tonal expression it also lowers image noise in photos shot at higher ISO settings ISO 100 to ISO 6400 enabling great results in low-light situations.    Be a Mover Not a Shaker   Any lens attached to the E-P2 will deliver blur-free images thanks to three modes of In-body Image Stabilization that compensate for up to four steps EV exposure value . Mechanical Image Stabilization automatically compensates for camera shake in low light or when shooting without a tripod. Since the PEN is the world s smallest interchangeable lens camera with In-body Image Stabilization you ll feel comfortable taking it on the road with you to capture the action. As an added advantage the built-in image stabilization works not only with the M. Zuiko lenses but all Four Thirds lenses and even older OM film-based lenses when used with the appropriate adapter for the E-P2.    Small Real Estate with an Amazing 3-Inch LCD View   Consumers accustomed to composing and focusing using a point-and-shoot camera s LCD will appreciate the E-P2 s 100 percent accurate 3-inch full color HyperCrystal LCD which gives them the same easy seamless experience when shooting still images or videos. The camera s Live Control function makes it easy to compose edit and shoot pictures or videos without stopping to access various menus. The E-P2 s fast Imager Autofocus in Live View also enables you to compose focus and capture the shot quickly and easily without ever taking your eyes off the large LCD.                       The LCD displays 230 000 pixels in vivid color and includes HyperCrystal technology which offers many times the contrast of conventional LCD monitors for easier viewing in both preview and playback. It also provides a wide viewing angle of 176 degrees which ensures that images can be composed from even the most obscure angles.    This Camera Leaves Others in the Dust   You don t have to waste precious time worrying about dust ruining the perfect image instead spend more of that time shooting with the E-P2. The proven Olympus Dust Reduction System produces spot-free photos with the exclusive Supersonic Wave Filter a patented ultrasonic technology that vibrates to remove dust and other particles from the front of the image sensor capturing it on a special adhesive membrane every time the camera is turned on.    What You See Is What You Get   When viewing the LCD in Live View Art Filter effects and settings like white balance and exposure are viewable right on the LCD and their impact is seen instantly on the display. Real-time monitoring offers amazing versatility and creative control and users who apply a setting have instant gratification because what they see on the camera s LCD is what they ve captured. For musicians used to applying audio effects like reverb to their instruments before recording them the concept of setting the E-P2 to capture precisely the kind of image they want before they press the shutter makes perfect sense. For imaging purists who want to shoot without filters and apply them to images inside the camera later or just edit images back at their computers the E-P2 provides these options and opens more in-the-field creative possibilities.    Mix It Up with Multiple Exposure   With the E-P2 s Multiple Exposure function available for still image capture you are free to tell a visual story your way whether in a portrait a landscape or a combination of both. The image capture options allow you to shoot one shot then another and combine them in real time or capture both shots separately and combine them in the camera later. Overlay your face on top of your pet s face. Create an identical twin of yourself. Put the moon in the sky at noon. Your ability to manipulate space and time makes this new creative multimedia device a veritable time machine.    Frame Your Works of Art Inside the PEN   You can often achieve greater photographic expression by framing a scene in a unique way. The E-P2 provides four aspect ratios that serve as masks to frame your image to the desired proportions including the standard 4 3 aspect ratio that is suited to an 8 x 10-inch enlargement the 16 9 aspect ratio that will display your images beautifully on a widescreen television and other popular aspect ratios such as 3 2 and 6 6. The Multi-Aspect Shooting further expresses your creative vision when combined with Art Filters and multiple exposures. What will you create Stereo Audio Sounds As Good As the PEN Images Look   Like the innovative Olympus LS-11 portable audio recording device that puts the power of a recording studio in your pocket the E-P2 features uncompressed CD-quality 16 bit 44.1kHz Linear PCM stereo recording capability to capture the rich sound quality of your scene. When you shoot with the E-P2 it s like having a sound technician built into your camera to capture the nuances of the audio happening all around you. It has the versatility to record and play back in the WAV format and can record with its built-in stereo microphone. Whether recording audio while shooting a video or adding audio by recording a narration to your still images the E-P2 s audio sounds as great as its images look. Now with the new stereo microphone adapter there is new freedom in audio capture with the PEN.    Create Your Own Multimedia Slideshows with Stills Video and Audio Inside E-P2   Content is king and with the E-P2 you have your own portable kingdom of still images HD video and audio to remix at your command. In playback mode you can seamlessly mix stills and movies inside the camera to create a multimedia slideshow dub in one of five built-in dramatic background music options to provide a soundtrack for your cinematic creation. Plug the E-P2 into any HD television with an HDMI cable and show off your masterpieces to your audience before your DVD arrives in stores As Easy to Use as a Point-and-Shoot with SLR-Quality Technologies   The E-P2 is equipped with 19 scene-select modes for effortless picture taking. Standard scene modes like Night-Scene Portrait and Landscape are easy-to-use solutions for everyday shooting. Capturing beautiful portraits is easy with the new ePortrait Mode. It enables you to smooth your subject s skin--all in the camera and before capture Additionally edits can be made post-capture using the ePortrait mode.    Shooting scenes with both highlights and shadows can often be a challenge because of the extreme contrast between dark and bright areas. The E-P2 addresses this challenge with Shadow Adjustment Technology that adjusts for extreme light variations and maintains visible detail in both the shadow and highlight areas of the scene. Now users can see and preview the gradation on the Live View LCD and capture images showing the shadow detail they saw. This feature is also accessible in the Edit menu after the shot has been taken.    The E-P2 s Face Detection reduces the chance of blurred subjects in images by recognizing up to eight people s faces and the background tracking the faces within the image area even if people are moving and automatically focusing and optimizing exposure for sharp brilliant portrait pictures ideal for large family or party group photos .    Don t like changing camera settings for each shooting situation The E-P2 s Intelligent Auto Mode automatically identifies what you re shooting Portrait Landscape Night Portrait Macro Sports and adjusts settings to capture the best result depending on the situation. First-time users will enjoy this quick and hassle-free feature which does the thinking for them and produces incredible images like a pro.    The E-P2 offers ease-of-use and flexibility to meet your shooting style. Choose the Live Control technology an advanced control panel system that incorporates the use of the sub dial and enables you to see the image and the menu controls all at the same time on the LCD. As a result you can use the main and sub dials to select modes and adjust settings without having to take your eyes off the subject. Or if you prefer shoot with the Super Control Panel which is familiar to any serious shooter. These options along with the camera s intuitive button layout make the camera simple to use. The E-P2 records to SDHC media cards to accommodate large files including videos with In-Camera Creative Features and uncompressed audio.    Digital Leveler   The E-P2 is equipped with an internal Digital Level Sensor that detects the camera s pitch and roll and indicates it on the control panel. This Digital Leveler is a tremendous benefit when capturing architecture and landscapes. Level the perfect coastline shot on your next tropical vacation without being tethered to a computer and editing software.    Magnified Focus Assist   The E-P2 provides two optional methods to help the user focus a Magnified Focus MF Assist Function and Magnification Display.

With HDTV the resolution is so much better that you can sit closer to a larger TV without noticing the pixels. So with HDTVs the rule tends to be you can sit anywhere from 1.5 to 3 times the screen size in inches for the best experience.

Jury dsunglasses  usa -  See all my reviews REAL NAME  This review is from Brother MFC-990CW Color Inkjet All-in-One with 5.8GHz Cordless Handset and Wireless Connectivity Electronics Despite all the models on the market and the rather cheap prices for All in ones it seems to be impossible to find one unit that does everything well. It s sort of like finding a mate you just might have to settle on some things. I previously had the HP 7310 all in one which I previously reviewed on here but a lightning storm fried the fax board in it. The rest of the unit still worked but I didn t want to get a separate fax machine. I called HP s customers service and all they wanted to do was sell me a new expensive unit at what they told me was a discount price. It was actually much cheaper elsewhere online. This would be a five star unit if not for some major flaws. I chose this unit mainly because it has an answering machine and cordless phone built in. I also liked the glossy black look of the unit.  The unit has a very nice 4.3 lcd touchscreen which works quite well. Its responsive has good color and easy to use. It tilts up and down but this is largely unnecessary. The menus however are a bit tricky to use and it takes some playing with it to find out where all your settings and adjustments are located. Also when using the screen to scroll answering machine messages I found it somewhat difficult to scroll back to listen to a previous message. It keeps taking you back to the beginning of the message you are listening too. It s actually easier to scroll forward and go back around if you don t have many message saved.  The buttons on the front are raised and are the perfect size. They have good tactile feel and they allow you to easily change your functions fax copy scan or photo capture.  There are some slots on the front of the unit for things like a USB flash drive which you can print your pictures directly from. It shows them on the lCD screen and you scroll through them. It also is Bluetooth and WIFI capable though mine is hooked with a wire so I haven t tried these. As far as the design of the unit its mostly good. Its smaller and more compact then many units. It only features a 15pg Adf versus the 30-50pg ones you see on some machines but I rarely need to fax or copy more then 5pgs at a time anyway. What matters more is that this unit actually scans all the pages one at time where my HP frequently would grab too many pages and you ended up having to send them through one at time. Faxing or printing in black in white was relatively quick though trying to fax in color took about a minute per page. You do not want this unit for printing pictures. The people came out looking so red it looked like they had been severely burned. Granted it was on regular paper but I ve printed decent pictured on regular paper before. You also will probably don t want this unit if you are going to do a lot of scanning photos. It has a 36bit scanner versus the 48bit seen on some other units.  The software in general I felt was good but the OCR software sucked. It scanned all the words right unlike my previous hp s software but it completely ignored all spacing and format. Not ideal if you want to scan and edit a form.  The power cord is not detachable from the unit not a big deal to me but it was datachable on my old HP. What I really didn t like was that the USB cord instead of attaching at the back is threaded up inside the machine. Because of the bulb near the end of the wire it requires bending and folding the wire some to get it attached and down in the triangle space provided. This is not good for the wire. The paper tray which pulls all the way out is rather flimsy is made of cheap plastic and only holds about 100pgs. However it s not as flimsy as some units such as Epson s Artisan 800 and a number of other units. More importantly though I ve had no paper jams and the pages don t drop on the floor after printing.  This unit like a number of Brother units also supposedly uses it own ink to periodically clean itself. You cant shut this off so even if not using the printer you will find your ink is being lowered. You only have to replace one cartridge at a time though. The real flaw with the unit is actually its biggest marketing feature the fact that it has a built in 30 min answering machine and an attached cordless phone. I use my phone and fax on the same line and was tired of having my answering machine conflict with the fax. By having them in the same unit I hoped to avoid this conflict and guess what It did. The machine knew when to pick up for messages or fax. No more conflict. Coodles to Brother for being the only manufacturer to offer a built in answering machine and cordless phone in some of their all in one units. Unfortunately Brother apparently chose to use cheap mics or speakers for its built in phone system. So much to my disappointment the answering machine messages come out garbled. Not all the time but about half the time. Why bother to include an answering machine if you are going to do such an unacceptable job I use my answering machine a lot and I don t want to have to guess what the message is saying. I tried just turning on my old answering machine and turning off Brothers but its fax then continues to try and pick up during calls. So I have to unplug the phone cord from the Brother which means you cant use the cordless phone.  The cordless phone looks and feels nice has raised buttons though not backlit and a decent orange backlit lcd screen and caller ID. Unfortunately the cordless phone also has speaker and or mic problems. Sometimes I can hear my echo while talking and sometimes other people complained of static noise on the other end. I sent my first one back and ordered another one from a different place thinking maybe I got a lemon but its has the same problems. Brother s customer service line was of no help at all. So now I m torn the unit looks nice prints text fast and well and faxes text quickly. Those are the main things I use it for so I ve thought about keeping it despite its major flaws. However I don t like the idea of keeping a brand new unit that comes with one of its major features being defective. Every unit on the market seems to have some types of flaws or problems so I m not sure where to settle.  UPDATE 9 5 2009- I decided to keep the unit and for the most part I am content with it. I would probably raise the the star rating to 3 or 4 despite the problems I mentioned. I managed to change the settings so that the fax doesn t always try to pick up and only does so now when I actually get a fax. I rarely use the cordless phone due to its speaker problems and I keep the answering machine off.  The USB port displays the pics from my flash drive on the LCD screen but takes awhile to load them and they are difficult to scroll through to find the ones you want.  I still haven t tried the wireless and probably won t since it s hooked to my computer. The paper tray needs to be a little bit bigger as I find I have to refill it a little too often. Also be warned this machine really burns through ink with it s automated cleaning process. I ve had to replace the black ink a few times already and the color inks are all half empty despite the fact I almost never print anything in color. I do think the text print quality was slightly better on my old HP but it s not a major difference. The scanner door feels like it isn t properly attached like it s going to come off but I beleive this is so you can lay bulky items on the scanner bed and still lay the door somewhat flat.  Overall I like the design of the unit and it has performed well with black amp white printing and faxing which are my primary uses for it.

February 2 2009        By Jase T. Wolfe   -  See all my reviews            Amazon Verified Purchase What s this  This review is from Brother MFC-990CW Color Inkjet All-in-One with 5.8GHz Cordless Handset and Wireless Connectivity Electronics Absolutely frustrating. Its been anything but a hassle-free setup from the moment it was removed from the box 1 It has flimsy parts. The paper tray has lots of internal parts you move around the hinges of which will bend or snap easily without much effort. The scanner lid is bizarrely loose acting like it would lift completely off but it doesn t resulting in an opening that isn t smooth but rather clunky. There is no manual feed area so anything like envelopes or labels you will need to load directly into the main paper area - real pain. 2 Printing quality is just OK. Perhaps good enough for general document printing but certainly not for images. You have to really crank up the settings to get anything but washed out colors - even then not a deep as desired. Very disappointing. Speed is quick enough loud however. 3 Scanning is decent enough for documents just not great for pictures you re trying to convert to high quality scans but has some behavior you have to get used to. If scanning from the bed and not the sheet feeder you can t select the area to scan instead it scans the whole region and you have to crop later. When scanning from the sheet feeder with items thinner than 8.5 inch the end scan always has the document correct on one side but lots of blank space on the other as though it only cropped part of it.  4 There is external media USB Keychain SD CF etc. slots in the front but the USB slot is recessed making it impossible to use any keychain drive that has a bulky body. If you plug in an external media USB Keychain SD CF etc. the printer dedicates itself to scanning it for pictures. If you have a large capacity media with lots of files that are not media you can have quite a wait. 5 If you use the phone you can t scan or copy. It tells you line in use and you need to either unplug it from the phone line or wait until you re off the call.  6 In Windows Vista with the printer attached to the network wirelessly I ve had the OS tell me the printer is offline while the local printer software tells me it s online requiring a reboot or two of Vista to get printing capabilities back.  On the plus side the touch-display is nice and easy to use the devices looks nice has a small enough footprint and does do a decent enough AIO job that it isn t the worst purchase I ve ever made but my next one won t be a Brother. As a parting comment their tech support is friendly which is good as you will be calling them.

I still haven t really got the fax part set up. The instructions indicate there could be confilcts between the fax function and voice mail which turned out to be true in my case and I still haven t wanted to get back to it. Every all in one I ve ever had HP Canon Pixma was a hassle to get phones faxes and voice mail all on the same page. My only disappointment was with the cordless telephone that comes with the machine. I had hoped that having it s own phone might eliminate that problem but it didn t. I then ordered two more handsets thinking the mix of the Brother machine and older Panasonic phones might be the problem. I never got around to fine-tuning the fax vs. voice mail with the new handsets because they are pretty cheesy and I just didn t like them. For example the display is tiny does not let you know when you ve missed a call and most annoying you have to do phonebook entries separately on each handset. That got real old real fast so I returned the Brother handsets and went back to my old phones. The other features of the machine such as the touchscreen menu screen ease of wireless network set up Bluetooth and ease of use accessibility of the print cartridges et. outweigh that one issue and I would buy it again.

What is APM APM stands for Action per Minute. It is a measure of how many clicks and key presses a gamer can do per minute with his mouse and keyboard.    Why is APM important APM is important because it measures your speed with which you re able to give out new commands. It is therefore a good indicator of the control over your game you have in terms of both micro and macromanagement.    What would be a standard APM For beginners an APM of around 40-60 is not uncommon. More experienced players will have between 100-150. Professional players have around 300 APM with some exceptions even exceeding that.    What is effective APM Effective APM or eAPM is a more accurate way of measuring APM as it only counts those clicks key presses that actually issue a command as opposed to standard APM which counts every single click and key press.    How does the APM-Lighting System work The APM-Lighting System is part of all our StarCraft II Peripherals. StarCraft II measures your effective actions per minute APM in-game and our peripherals will draw that data and will change lighting accordingly. In addition to that it will also register any in-game alerts like Base under attack or Unit Built and each of the alerts can have individual lighting settings that will be reflected on your peripherals.

Unique Hybrid Technology   Ovi Maps is built on an advanced technology called hybrid vector maps. Vector maps are high quality but less data intensive and allow you to continue to navigate even if you lose your network connection. This means that maps downloaded or updated across a network connection are about half the size of bulky bitmaps used by other mobile map providers. The hybrid technology ensures that unlike other providers any downloaded map data is stored on the device for future use.    No Network Connection Required When Navigating   Avoid expensive battery-draining network connections with Nokia s unique hybrid technology. Maps can be pre-loaded on to your Nokia smartphone so you can set Ovi Maps to offline mode saving battery power and the navigation system will still work. This is particularly useful for those worried about data connection costs when travelling abroad or when you are travelling through areas with little or no network coverage.    Best Global Coverage   You take your mobile with you wherever you go in the world so as standard voice guided navigation for both pedestrians and drivers is available for 74 countries in 46 different languages and there are maps for over 180 countries. This gives you the best maps with the largest global coverage for free.

Achieve Perfect Fit and Seal   In-Ear Fit Guide   Sound quality and bass response are dependent on the seal achieved between the ear tips and your ear canal. Please try the various sizes of ear tips included with your earphone to determine which gives you the best sound and comfort. The sound may change depending on the insertion depth and tip size.   To achieve proper insertion pull up and back on the top of your ear helix and or use a slight bit of lubrication moisture on the outer part of the ear tips which will help achieve the proper insertion depth and angle. If you feel your MEE earphones do not have bass or sound tinny the fit and or seal is more than likely problematic. You can visit the MEElectronics online product manual for more information and assistance.   Burn-In   Many owners have stated that the sound may improve with use when compared to the out of the box sound. This change in sound will occur with normal listening and is not necessary however you can accelerate this process by playing music at a normal volume continuously for the first several days.

Maynard Dallas Tx -  See all my reviews VINE VOICE   REAL NAME  This review is from Logitech V220 Cordless Optical Mouse for Notebooks Dark Silver  Electronics Customer review from the Amazon Vine Program What s this  Logitech s V220 is ergonomically designed and has soft rubber grips on both sides. It uses one AA battery which is nice you don t have to scour the planet trying to find the right battery to use. The tilt wheel is large making it easy to operate. The left and right mouse buttons operate smoothly. There is a battery warning LED which is green if the battery is good and turns red when the battery is low. This is a great feature. Another thing I love about this product is the off on switch on the bottom of the mouse. If you are going to be typing or reading for a while and won t be needing to use the mouse you can simply turn it off and save battery life. The receiver slides into the bottom of the mouse and is designed to turn off the mouse when you slide it in and turn on the mouse when you slide it out.   The only complaint I have is the instruction pamphlet could have been a little clearer about which way to install the battery. The diagram shows the stud of the positive end of the battery going first into the mouse but it has a very small - sign on the end with a small side on the other end. A quick glance leads you to put the positive end first just by how the drawing looks.  I purchased a bargain store brand cordless mouse that was much smaller had a tiny tilt wheel with an automatic shut off that allows the battery to run down for several minutes before shutting off. The Logitech V220 for the same price puts the bargain brands to shame. It s the only cordless notebook mouse you will ever need.

The V220 is a pretty good mouse considering the price tag. It s compact and rugged looking with rubber pads at the sides for a good grip.   It only needs one AA battery Note the diagram is misleading with regard to the way to put in the battery. You should see the side when you re closing the top You can use it for desktops as well as laptops.  There s storage space for the receiver at the bottom and once you click it into place the mouse automatically shuts off.   The ridged rubber wheel is the noisy variety and goes click click click all the way home.  It comes with no software but gives you a link to the website where you can get a download to make the mouse do tricks. After the download you can scroll from side to side click and roll to zoom and if you give it a shove it can even roll over and play dead.  It has a warning light to tell you when your battery needs changing.  It doesn t come with a case or pouch but looks like it can handle going commando just fine.  In summary it s a good mouse but not a great mouse - and well worth the price.

Well-built and improved over older models. October 15 2007        By almosthappy San Diego CA California -  See all my reviews VINE VOICE  This review is from Logitech V220 Cordless Optical Mouse for Notebooks Dark Silver  Electronics Customer review from the Amazon Vine Program What s this  I use my Thinkpad laptop quite a lot so a reliable wireless mouse that s both low-maintenance and comfortable is very important to me. I have used an older model of Logitech wireless notebook mouse before and frankly I was not too impressed. Compared the said older model with my Microsoft Wireless Notebook Optical Mouse 4000 which has been my mouse of choice for almost a year now the older Logitech model came up short on a few design considerations. First the general feel of key presses Microsoft mouse buttons are very responsive and be clearly depressed with a comfortable amount of pressure the older Logitech on the other hand felt ambiguous at times - user doesn t know for sure if a button has been depressed. Secondly the USB RF connector on the Logitech is always loose when reattached to the mouse when not in use resulting in pre-mature power-drain. Luckily LogitechV220 has been re-vamped to address just these issues. Now I use my trustworthy Microsoft 4000 and the Logitech V220 almost interchably and not even noticing the difference a lot of the times. And I believe that s a good thing a well-built mouse should be unobtrusive and becomes almost a natural extension of the computing environment - something that s so natural users don t even realize its presence. In this regard Logitech V220 has done a tremendous job to up their previous effort.

The NEX-3 stands apart as the world s smallest interchangeable lens camera.3 Experience gorgeous HD movies 1 astounding low-light pictures continuous shooting up to 7 fps incredible panorama shots and Live View on a tilting 3 LCD4.,Sony has engineered an impressively small camera that takes incredibly good photographs. In fact the a NEX-3 camera has all quality of a DSLR in about half the size and weight. Pulling off this minor miracle took some clever innovations in glass silicon and software code.    Sony Alpha NEX-3 Overview and Highlights     Bigger Sensor Better Pictures                       In technical terms the APS-C image sensor is approximately 13 times the size of the typical sensor. In human terms you ll be taking photographs not snapshots. The bigger sensor means softer backgrounds for more attractive portraits. You ll see better into the dark after sunset and all your pictures will benefit from 14.2-megapixel resolution.    The NEX-5 and NEX-3 are equipped with a powerful new 14.2-megapixel Exmor APS HD CMOS sensor specially tuned to deliver uncompromising still-photo and movie image quality. Equal in surface area and performance to the large APS-C image sensors used in Sony s acclaimed a system digital SLR cameras it offers exceptionally rich tonal gradation and true-to-life color. Proprietary Sony processing technologies are also incorporated directly into the sensor assuring clean low-noise signal output and ultra high-speed data transfer.      World s Smallest and Lightest                      The NEX-3 delivers the quality of a DSLR in a camera that s ready to go wherever you go. In fact this is the world s smallest lightest interchangeable lens digital camera as of April 2010 . It s roughly half the size and weight of Sony s smallest lightest DSLR the a230.    Equipped with an image sensor that s 13 times the size of the typical compact camera s sensor a NEX cameras turn snapshots into photographs. The bigger sensor means images with softer background that make your subject stand out and stunning low-light shots.      Expect More from a Camera   Sony has always recognized that a digital camera could take pictures in ways that film cameras never dreamed of. That s why we ve created new capabilities to take your photography further than ever. These include Sweep Panorama Auto HDR Handheld Twilight and Anti Motion Blur modes.    Thanks to their powerful Exmor CMOS image sensor and BIONZ image processing engine both these cameras can offer high-speed continuous shooting at up to 7 fps approx. in Speed Priority Continuous mode and at up to 2.3 fps approx. in Continuous Advance mode. In addition their 10-second self-timer also has a 3-shot continuous shooting setting.                       Hand-held Twilight Mode takes six shots at high speed when the shutter is pressed and then aligns and merges them into a single image significantly reducing the graininess and noise that can degrade image quality when shooting in extremely low light. Combined with the outstanding low-noise performance of the Exmor CMOS image sensor it lets you take exceptionally clear beautiful nighttime photos without using a tripod or flash.    Like Hand-held Twilight mode Anti Motion Blur mode uses exclusive Sony image analysis and alignment technologies to combine six shots into a single image. Ideal for low-light and telephoto shooting it makes it easy to get clear images that capture the mood and atmosphere of the moment.      HD Movie   Capture vivid lifelike HD movies in the PC-friendly MP4 format. The NEX-3 gives you a choice of 720 30p high definition or standard definition 480 30p.                       One-touch recording means there s no need to fumble with menu settings when you want to shoot a movie--recording can be started or stopped simply by pressing the dedicated MOVIE button.    When you re shooting movies in AF mode with an E-mount lens the camera smoothly adjusts focus and exposure in response to changes in the scene and you can use the control wheel to instantly adjust exposure compensation on the fly. If desired you can also preselect white balance and Creative Style settings before movie recording begins.    Although many recent video cameras incorporate high-power zoom lenses none can match the framing flexibility and creative freedom of interchangeable lenses. With the NEX-5 and NEX-3 you get a choice of dedicated E-mount lenses for wide-angle standard zoom and high-power zoom shooting optional ultra wide-angle and fisheye converters and--via a simple mount adaptor--the full range and world-class optics of the a digital SLR lens lineup.      Sophistication Made Simple                      Some cameras bristle with knobs buttons and dials. The NEX-3 replaces them with a simple turn-and-click Control Wheel and a pair of Soft Keys. These give you easy access to the full power of digital photography. To make learning even easier Sony includes an On-Screen Help Guide and On-Screen Tips.    iAuto mode automatically applies exposure values and Scene Selection modes that are optimized to suit each scene. What s more they combine this full-auto convenience with a Background Defocus Control function that lets you enjoy one of the biggest creative advantages of interchangeable lens photography--the ability to defocus the background to make your main subject stand out from the scene. Just press and rotate the control wheel to set the level of background defocusing you want--it s easy and intuitive because you can confirm the level of defocusing on the LCD monitor in real-time.    In addition to basic Help Guide information these cameras are also equipped with built-in shooting tips. The tips provide information relevant to the current shooting situation or mode selection and are designed with both beginners and more advanced users in mind. Two types of tip are offered 1 tips about particular types of subject and scene and 2 tips on general photographic technique. Since the entire library of shooting tips can also be accessed via the Camera menu and viewed as a single guidebook it s like having a complete photography tutorial built right into your camera.                       The main menu features six clearly labeled icons that can be selected simply by rotating and pressing the control wheel. Inside standard scrolling menus provide quick access to settings for shooting and playback functions as well as a host of other user preferences and camera settings. The wide-screen format of the LCD monitor also contributes to enhanced menu legibility so text and icons are always easy to see and select.      The Creativity of Changing Lenses   The beauty of SLR photography is the ability to change lenses to match your shooting situation. Now Sony brings that beauty to a compact camera. The NEX-3 gives you a choice of dedicated E-mount lenses plus a choice of 28 A-mount lenses via an adaptor sold separately.,8.7 x 5.8 x 4.7 inches,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41E1iM07wzL._AA300_.jpg,2.2 pounds,3 pounds,,"<ul><li>The quality of a DSLR in about half the size, weight</li> <li>World's smallest, lightest interchangeable lens camera</li> <li>Same APS-C sensor size, same resolution as Alpha DSLRs</li> <li>14.2 MP; up to 7 fps shooting; ISO 12800 sensitivity</li> <li>Sweep Panorama captures incredible landscapes</li> </ul>"

With virtually instant data access times SSDs also outperform traditional hard drives in data lookup file transfers and other disk-intensive work.           Longer Battery Life   Using an SSD with your notebook or netbook means you ll enjoy longer battery life. Traditional mechanical hard drives consume large amounts of power to start up and seek data. With no moving parts SSDs use less of your precious battery power resulting in longer running times.            Tougher and More Durable   Because an SSD uses all solid-state electronics with no moving parts it can handle shock and vibration far in excess of traditional hard drives and will survive wider temperature swings. For durability and toughness on the road nothing outperforms an SSD.,6.0 x 4.8 x 0.3 inches,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41KO5merudL._SL500_AA300_.jpg,1.3 ounces,1 pounds,,"<ul><li>Latest generation Sandforce controller and MLC NAND flash for fast performance</li> <li>Fast Performance-Games, applications and files load faster, while your system is more responsive</li> <li>Flexible use-2.5"" form factor for your notebook or netbook needs, or use with included 3.5"" bracket for your desktop computer</li> <li>Included 2.5"" to 3.5"" bracket for installation on your desktop computer</li> <li>No moving parts for increased durability and reliability and quieter operations over standard hard disk drives</li> </ul>"

You can enjoy stable results even if you re trotting alongside your subject.            Super LoLux          Low light performance is one of the key factors for quality video. New Everio s Super LoLux ensures superior sensitivity to low light. To provide this High Definition models selected are equipped with a Back-illuminated CMOS sensor that allows intake of more light while Standard Definition models offer a large 1 6 high-sensitivity CCD. The result is clear images with precise colors even in low light. No worry while indoors or in dark situations.        Time Lapse REC    Various unique shooting functions are equipped on New Everio. Time-Lapse REC records one frame at a time at set intervals 1sec. 80sec. . So you can watch an hour-long movement in just a short amount of time when played back. It s great when you want to observe an event that takes place over a long period of time or to record unique-looking scenes in a creative way.        Auto REC       Another unique function is Auto REC. When a subject enters the detecting area and the luminance changes recording starts automatically. Recording continues as long as there is movement within the area and automatically stops after 5 seconds of no movement. You can use it like a surveillance camera or to observe something. Discover new ways to use the camera.       Bluetooth Technology   GZ-HM550 features built-in Bluetooth Wireless Technology.

Multi-Touch   iPod touch features the same revolutionary interface as iPhone.   Glide Flick Pinch   Built to take full advantage of the large 3.5-inch display the Multi-Touch touchscreen interface lets you control everything using only your fingers. So you can glide through albums with Cover Flow flick through photos and enlarge them with a pinch zoom in and out on a section of a web page and control game elements precisely.    How it Works   The Multi-Touch display layers a protective shield over a capacitive panel that senses your touch using electrical fields. It then transmits that information to the LCD screen below it. iPod touch software enables the flick tap and pinch.    Type with the Touchscreen Keyboard   iPod touch features an intelligent touchscreen keyboard perfect for browsing the web in Safari getting directions on a map searching for videos on YouTube finding music on the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store or adding new contacts. It analyzes keystrokes to suggest words as you type and correct spelling errors automatically. And because it s software based it changes its keys to support typing in multiple languages.           iPod touch locates nearby wireless hotspots including protected networks.              Accelerometer   iPod touch responds to motion using a built-in accelerometer.   Responds to Movement   iPod touch detects when you rotate it from portrait to landscape then automatically changes the contents of the display. So you immediately see the entire width of a web page view a photo in its proper aspect ratio or control a game using only your movements.    How it Works   The accelerometer inside iPod touch uses three elements a silicon mass a set of silicon springs and an electrical current. The silicon springs measure the position of the silicon mass using the electrical current. Rotating iPod touch causes a fluctuation in the electrical current passing through the silicon springs. The accelerometer registers these fluctuations and tells iPod touch to adjust the display accordingly.    Perfect for Gaming   Accelerometer technology really shines when you play games because it immerses you in the action. It s perfect for racing games--where your entire iPod touch acts as a steering wheel--and for tap-and-tilt games like Super Monkey Ball in which your character responds to your every movement.       Wireless   Connect iPod touch to the Internet anywhere there s a wireless network.   Connect Automatically   iPod touch locates nearby wireless hotspots including protected networks. If you ve never used a particular network it asks you to enter a password the first time and it remembers the password from then on. So the next time you re within range it connects automatically.

The JZ500 also has a new mode dial for additional convenience and functionality.    FinePix Highlights     HD Capability   The new J-Series models all offer stunning movies in 720p with sound and high quality stills at 1920 x 1080. Many consumers are happy to enjoy HD movies on their PC but with the new HD Player optional extra which comes equipped with a remote control families can gather around their home HDTV to enjoy amazingly detailed stills and high resolution movie playback.    Tracking Auto Focus   Previously featured on Fujifilm s DSLR-styled FinePix S1500 the new J-Series models feature Tracking Auto Focus which is perfect for when you need to take a picture of a moving subject and can t keep your subject in the frame. Just switch Tracking Auto Focus on and it will track your subject and ensure that you achieve a crisp picture with you subject in the center of the frame in perfect focus.    Face Recognition Technology   For the first time on a Fujifilm digital camera you can identify the people in a picture by name Fujifilm s Face Recognition Technology gives you the ability to pre-program 8 people into the camera. To do this you start by taking a picture of the person you want to program into the camera and then tell the camera who that person is e.g. Mom . You also have the option of inputting the category she belongs to e.g. friends family and the date of her birthday. The next time you go to take a photo of her the camera will cleverly recognize Mom and optimize the settings to ensure that exposure and focus are best suited to her rather than the other people in the picture. This fun technology can recognize up to 5 pre-programmed people on screen at the same time.    In addition the FinePix JZ500 s new Picture Search Tool is able to use the Face Recognition data name birthday and category to help you find and playback your photographs quickly and easily. If you want to scroll through all pictures featuring Mom for example the camera will be able to select them for you for easy viewing.    Pet Detection   For those who enjoy the company of four-legged friends the FinePix JZ500 comes equipped with Fujifilm s brand new Pet Detection technology allowing users the ability to detect up to 10 faces of dogs or cats and automatically optimize the focus. The FinePix JZ500 is programmed to recognize 57 of the F d ration Cyno Logique Internationale FCI registered dogs 80 of the Top 20 Dogs in the American Kennel Club AKC Ranking and 60 of The Cat Fancier s Association CFA breeds. Pet Detection works by matching various dog or cat data of facial parts with patterns to detect the dog or cat being photographed.    Additional Features      Scene Recognition Auto SR AUTO  This mode intelligently detects the scene type you are shooting and optimizes the camera s focus exposure and white balance so whether you re photographing flowers or a holiday landscape you will get flawless photos at the press of a button.    Dual Image Stabilization Long-zoom cameras need stabilization more than any other compact with handshake and subject movement a particular problem in low light at telephoto range. The FinePix JZ500 reduces blur to a minimum by deploying Picture Stabilization to automatically increase shutter speeds to freeze action and mechanical CCD sensor shift stabilization to counteract the problems of handshake. By cleverly combining these two blur is reduced to an absolute minimum.    Face Detection and Automatic Red-eye Removal To provide perfectly exposed and focused portrait shots each J-Series model is fitted with Fujifilm s latest Face Detection technology which is able to track up to 10 faces simultaneously at almost any angle to the camera. The system instantly corrects red-eye and then saves both the original and the corrected image file automatically.,6.7 x 5.5 x 2.8 inches,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417nlyPVyAL._SL500_AA300_.jpg,5.3 ounces,1 pounds,,"<ul><li>14-megapixel resolution for large, photo-quality prints</li> <li>Capture HD movies in 720p with sound; Dual Direction GUI and Dual Image Display</li> <li>Fujinon 10x wide-angle optical zoom lens (28mm-280mm equivalent); dual image stablization</li> <li>Tracking Auto Focus; Face Recognition and Pet Detection technology</li> <li>Scene Recognition Auto (SR AUTO)</li> </ul>"

Unique Hybrid Technology   Ovi Maps is built on an advanced technology called hybrid vector maps. Vector maps are high quality but less data intensive and allow you to continue to navigate even if you lose your network connection. This means that maps downloaded or updated across a network connection are about half the size of bulky bitmaps used by other mobile map providers. The hybrid technology ensures that unlike other providers any downloaded map data is stored on the device for future use.   No Network Connection Required When Navigating   Avoid expensive battery-draining network connections with Nokia s unique hybrid technology. Maps can be pre-loaded on to your Nokia smartphone so you can set Ovi Maps to offline mode saving battery power and the navigation system will still work. This is particularly useful for those worried about data connection costs when travelling abroad or when you are travelling through areas with little or no network coverage.   Best Global Coverage   You take your mobile with you wherever you go in the world so as standard voice guided navigation for both pedestrians and drivers is available for 74 countries in 46 different languages and there are maps for over 180 countries. This gives you the best maps with the largest global coverage for free.,4.1 x 2.1 x 0.5 inches,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41XltSOn6QL._SL500_AA300_.jpg,4.5 ounces,13.6 ounces,,"<ul><li>Unlocked quad-band GSM cell phone compatible with WCDMA 850/900/1700/1900/2100 GSM/EDGE 850/900/1800/1900, WCDMA 900/1700/1900/2100 GSM/EDGE 850/900/1800/1900</li><li>3G-enabled messaging phone in silver with 3.2-inch touchscreen and quick access to messaging, e-mail, and social networks</li><li>8-megapixel camera; 720p HD camcorder; Bluetooth stereo music; microSD memory expansion to 32 GB; GPS with free Ovi Maps Navigation voice-guided directions</li><li>Up to 4.5 hours of 3G talk time, up to 408 hours (17 days) of standby time; released in December, 2010</li><li>What's in the Box: handset, rechargeable battery, compact travel charger, 2 GB microSD memory card, stereo headset, connectivity cable, quick start guide, user manual</li></ul>"

Accell UltraAv cables offer superb performance and reliablity. Featuring high-quality materials and construction these cables will optimize the performance of your A V system.             Quality construction enables superior performance             Not All HDMI Cable Companies are the Same     Making a quality HDMI cable that is compliant with HDMI Specification requires premium materials and skilled workmanship. HDMI cables are sensitive to variances in construction especially over long runs. A poorly made HDMI cable can affect picture quality causing artifacts such as snow or colored speckles or effects like ghosting especially during dark sequences or scene transitions.   Most cable companies don t have their own factories and are simply resellers sourcing HDMI cables from third parties. Purchasing cables from a third party can make it difficult to ensure performance and quality.   Accell is different. Employees at Accell s cable factory engineer design assemble and quality check cables in-house ensuring that the highest levels of quality and performance are built into every cable. Accell HDMI cables are constructed using only superior components. From their 24K gold-plated HDMI connectors to their oxygen-free copper conductors Accell cables are certified 100 HDMI compliant.    Available in Lengths up to 65 Feet      For long cable runs the UltraAV cable is also available in 25-foot 32-foot 50-foot and 65-foot lengths. These longer cables use thick 24 gauge 50-foot and 65-foot and 26 gauge 25-foot and 32-foot copper conductors. This construction delivers exceptional digital singal transfer over long cable runs. Suitable for in-wall installation these long-length cables are Underwriters Laboratory UL Listed and CL3 rated according to the National Electrical Code.   Due to the extended length of the 50-foot and 65-foot cables they provide a maximum throughput of 4.95 Gbps compatible with HDMI 1.2.             Coordinate component throughput  for the best picture and sound             What HDMI Cable Speed Do You Need Throughput is the maximum amount of data that can pass through a cable. HDMI cable throughput is measured in gigabits per second Gbps . The number of gigabits that can pass through an HDMI cable in one second is considered the cable s throughput. Throughput is also referred to as cable speed and the more gigabits that can pass through an HDMI cable the greater the cable s speed.   When you assemble a home theater system it s important that all of the components including the cables share a similar specification. If one piece of your system such as your television has a maximum resolution of 720p and your DVD player has a resolution of 1080i the DVD player will automatically scale down the video to 720p--the most your TV can handle. You re not getting all you can out of your home theater experience.   The same goes for your HDMI cable. If it isn t correctly matched to your system it won t have enough throughput to handle all of the audio and video signal causing the system to scale down. For example instead of getting the billions of colors in a 36-bit Deep Color feature your system could scale down to lesser 24-bit color if the wrong capacity cable is in place.

To help you get a great 3D experience use the checklist below to ensure you have everything you need. 3D viewing requires A Display   First you ll need a 3D-ready display--whether it s a 3D HDTV 3D projector or 3D computer monitor. These displays have more processing power than standard 2D models for displaying 3D images in rapid succession.           A Source   Your display may be ready for 3D playback but you ll still need a device to read 3D content. This can be a cable box with a subscription to a 3D channel a 3D Blu-ray Disc player or a PlayStation 3 system.           3D Content   3D content--the actual entertainment in other words--will be played back using the source mentioned above whether it s a 3D broadcast from your cable provider a 3D Blu-ray Disc or a 3D video game.           3D Glasses   For now the vast majority of 3D HDTVs require glasses for 3D viewing. Many use powered active shutter glasses others polarized passive glasses. You ll need one pair per viewer and they ll have to be compatible with your display whether they re the same brand or a pair of universal glasses designed to work across brands.           HDMI Cable   To connect your source such as a 3D Blu-ray Disc player to your display you ll need a high-speed HDMI cable. Cables with this designation feature bandwidth speeds up to 10.2 Gbps gigabits per second for carrying the 3D signal without any loss of quality.

These displays have more processing power than standard 2D models for displaying 3D images in rapid succession.           A Source   Your display may be ready for 3D playback but you ll still need a device to read 3D content. This can be a cable box with a subscription to a 3D channel a 3D Blu-ray Disc player or a PlayStation 3 system.           3D Content   3D content--the actual entertainment in other words--will be played back using the source mentioned above whether it s a 3D broadcast from your cable provider a 3D Blu-ray Disc or a 3D video game.           3D Glasses   For now the vast majority of 3D HDTVs require glasses for 3D viewing. Many use powered active shutter glasses others polarized passive glasses. You ll need one pair per viewer and they ll have to be compatible with your display whether they re the same brand or a pair of universal glasses designed to work across brands.           HDMI Cable   To connect your source such as a 3D Blu-ray Disc player to your display you ll need a high-speed HDMI cable.

Unique Hybrid Technology   Ovi Maps is built on an advanced technology called hybrid vector maps. Vector maps are high quality but less data intensive and allow you to continue to navigate even if you lose your network connection. This means that maps downloaded or updated across a network connection are about half the size of bulky bitmaps used by other mobile map providers. The hybrid technology ensures that unlike other providers any downloaded map data is stored on the device for future use.   No Network Connection Required When Navigating   Avoid expensive battery-draining network connections with Nokia s unique hybrid technology. Maps can be pre-loaded on to your Nokia smartphone so you can set Ovi Maps to offline mode saving battery power and the navigation system will still work. This is particularly useful for those worried about data connection costs when travelling abroad or when you are travelling through areas with little or no network coverage.   Best Global Coverage   You take your mobile with you wherever you go in the world so as standard voice guided navigation for both pedestrians and drivers is available for 74 countries in 46 different languages and there are maps for over 180 countries. This gives you the best maps with the largest global coverage for free.,6.8 x 5.4 x 1.9 inches,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516%2BdiKaeFL._SL500_AA300_.jpg,6.2 ounces,12.8 ounces,,"<ul><li>Unlocked quad-band GSM cell phone compatible with 850/900/1800/1900 frequencies and US/International 3G compatibility via 850/900/1700/1900/2100 UMTS/HSDPA plus GPRS/EDGE capabilities</li><li>3G-enabled smartphone in silver with 4-inch AMOLED touchscreen, slide-out QWERTY keyboard, and Symbian^3 operating system</li><li>Corporate e-mail capabilities; 8-MP camera with 720p video capture; Wireless-N Wi-Fi; Bluetooth 3.0; 16 GB internal memory; HDMI output</li><li>Up to 5 hours of talk time, up to 480 hours (20 days) of standby time; released in November, 2010</li><li>What's in the Box: handset, rechargeable battery, charger, wired stereo headset, USB cable, HDMI cable, quick start guide, user manual</li></ul>"

Natural Flash Conventional point-and-shoot camera flash shots just don t capture colors the way the eye sees them. Natural Flash mode takes a reference shot without flash and then uses that reference to correct the color for far more lifelike images.             HDMI output The High-Definition Multimedia Interface HDMI is a compact audio video connector interface for transmitting uncompressed digital streams. HDMI connects digital audio video sources such as a compatible camcorder Blu-ray Disc player a personal computer a video game console or an AV receiver to a compatible digital audio device and or video monitor such as a digital television DTV . Easily connect your Cyber-shot camera via HDMI cable sold separately to any compatible HDMI device to easily enjoy and upload content.  6             Smile Shutter technology   Smile Shutter technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter button and the camera does the rest. You can also select adult and child priority and indicate the degree of Smile Detection sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can be used together with Smile Shutter mode. This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting.           Face Detection technology   Sony s Face Detection technology can automatically distinguish between children and adults. Face Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts flash focus exposure and white balance to help deliver crisp properly lit images of family and friends.       Motion Detection  Motion Detection along with Face Motion Detection adjusts ISO sensitivity and increases the shutter speed when movement is detected reducing blur in moving subjects and faces.       Anti-blink Function   It s frustrating to capture the perfect shot only to review it later and discover subjects blinked during the photo. When the camera is set to Soft Snap the Anti-blink function captures two images recording only the photo with less squinting or blinking. If a blink is detected in other shooting modes a warning will be displayed after you take the shot.

The NEX-3 stands apart as the world s smallest interchangeable lens camera.3 Experience gorgeous HD movies 1 astounding low-light pictures continuous shooting up to 7 fps incredible panorama shots and Live View on a tilting 3 LCD4.,Sony has engineered an impressively small camera that takes incredibly good photographs. In fact the a NEX-3 camera has all quality of a DSLR in about half the size and weight. Pulling off this minor miracle took some clever innovations in glass silicon and software code.    Sony Alpha NEX-3 Overview and Highlights     Bigger Sensor Better Pictures                       In technical terms the APS-C image sensor is approximately 13 times the size of the typical sensor. In human terms you ll be taking photographs not snapshots. The bigger sensor means softer backgrounds for more attractive portraits. You ll see better into the dark after sunset and all your pictures will benefit from 14.2-megapixel resolution.    The NEX-5 and NEX-3 are equipped with a powerful new 14.2-megapixel Exmor APS HD CMOS sensor specially tuned to deliver uncompromising still-photo and movie image quality. Equal in surface area and performance to the large APS-C image sensors used in Sony s acclaimed a system digital SLR cameras it offers exceptionally rich tonal gradation and true-to-life color. Proprietary Sony processing technologies are also incorporated directly into the sensor assuring clean low-noise signal output and ultra high-speed data transfer.      World s Smallest and Lightest                      The NEX-3 delivers the quality of a DSLR in a camera that s ready to go wherever you go. In fact this is the world s smallest lightest interchangeable lens digital camera as of April 2010 . It s roughly half the size and weight of Sony s smallest lightest DSLR the a230.    Equipped with an image sensor that s 13 times the size of the typical compact camera s sensor a NEX cameras turn snapshots into photographs. The bigger sensor means images with softer background that make your subject stand out and stunning low-light shots.      Expect More from a Camera   Sony has always recognized that a digital camera could take pictures in ways that film cameras never dreamed of. That s why we ve created new capabilities to take your photography further than ever. These include Sweep Panorama Auto HDR Handheld Twilight and Anti Motion Blur modes.    Thanks to their powerful Exmor CMOS image sensor and BIONZ image processing engine both these cameras can offer high-speed continuous shooting at up to 7 fps approx. in Speed Priority Continuous mode and at up to 2.3 fps approx. in Continuous Advance mode. In addition their 10-second self-timer also has a 3-shot continuous shooting setting.                       Hand-held Twilight Mode takes six shots at high speed when the shutter is pressed and then aligns and merges them into a single image significantly reducing the graininess and noise that can degrade image quality when shooting in extremely low light. Combined with the outstanding low-noise performance of the Exmor CMOS image sensor it lets you take exceptionally clear beautiful nighttime photos without using a tripod or flash.    Like Hand-held Twilight mode Anti Motion Blur mode uses exclusive Sony image analysis and alignment technologies to combine six shots into a single image. Ideal for low-light and telephoto shooting it makes it easy to get clear images that capture the mood and atmosphere of the moment.      HD Movie   Capture vivid lifelike HD movies in the PC-friendly MP4 format. The NEX-3 gives you a choice of 720 30p high definition or standard definition 480 30p.                       One-touch recording means there s no need to fumble with menu settings when you want to shoot a movie--recording can be started or stopped simply by pressing the dedicated MOVIE button.    When you re shooting movies in AF mode with an E-mount lens the camera smoothly adjusts focus and exposure in response to changes in the scene and you can use the control wheel to instantly adjust exposure compensation on the fly. If desired you can also preselect white balance and Creative Style settings before movie recording begins.    Although many recent video cameras incorporate high-power zoom lenses none can match the framing flexibility and creative freedom of interchangeable lenses. With the NEX-5 and NEX-3 you get a choice of dedicated E-mount lenses for wide-angle standard zoom and high-power zoom shooting optional ultra wide-angle and fisheye converters and--via a simple mount adaptor--the full range and world-class optics of the a digital SLR lens lineup.      Sophistication Made Simple                      Some cameras bristle with knobs buttons and dials. The NEX-3 replaces them with a simple turn-and-click Control Wheel and a pair of Soft Keys. These give you easy access to the full power of digital photography. To make learning even easier Sony includes an On-Screen Help Guide and On-Screen Tips.    iAuto mode automatically applies exposure values and Scene Selection modes that are optimized to suit each scene. What s more they combine this full-auto convenience with a Background Defocus Control function that lets you enjoy one of the biggest creative advantages of interchangeable lens photography--the ability to defocus the background to make your main subject stand out from the scene. Just press and rotate the control wheel to set the level of background defocusing you want--it s easy and intuitive because you can confirm the level of defocusing on the LCD monitor in real-time.    In addition to basic Help Guide information these cameras are also equipped with built-in shooting tips. The tips provide information relevant to the current shooting situation or mode selection and are designed with both beginners and more advanced users in mind. Two types of tip are offered 1 tips about particular types of subject and scene and 2 tips on general photographic technique. Since the entire library of shooting tips can also be accessed via the Camera menu and viewed as a single guidebook it s like having a complete photography tutorial built right into your camera.                       The main menu features six clearly labeled icons that can be selected simply by rotating and pressing the control wheel. Inside standard scrolling menus provide quick access to settings for shooting and playback functions as well as a host of other user preferences and camera settings. The wide-screen format of the LCD monitor also contributes to enhanced menu legibility so text and icons are always easy to see and select.      The Creativity of Changing Lenses   The beauty of SLR photography is the ability to change lenses to match your shooting situation. Now Sony brings that beauty to a compact camera. The NEX-3 gives you a choice of dedicated E-mount lenses plus a choice of 28 A-mount lenses via an adaptor sold separately.,8.7 x 5.8 x 4.7 inches,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41E1iM07wzL._AA300_.jpg,2.2 pounds,3 pounds,,"<ul><li>The quality of a DSLR in about half the size, weight</li> <li>World's smallest, lightest interchangeable lens camera</li> <li>Same APS-C sensor size, same resolution as Alpha DSLRs</li> <li>14.2 MP; up to 7 fps shooting; ISO 12800 sensitivity</li> <li>Sweep Panorama captures incredible landscapes</li> </ul>"

Unique Hybrid Technology   Ovi Maps is built on an advanced technology called hybrid vector maps. Vector maps are high quality but less data intensive and allow you to continue to navigate even if you lose your network connection. This means that maps downloaded or updated across a network connection are about half the size of bulky bitmaps used by other mobile map providers. The hybrid technology ensures that unlike other providers any downloaded map data is stored on the device for future use.   No Network Connection Required When Navigating   Avoid expensive battery-draining network connections with Nokia s unique hybrid technology. Maps can be pre-loaded on to your Nokia smartphone so you can set Ovi Maps to offline mode saving battery power and the navigation system will still work. This is particularly useful for those worried about data connection costs when travelling abroad or when you are travelling through areas with little or no network coverage.   Best Global Coverage   You take your mobile with you wherever you go in the world so as standard voice guided navigation for both pedestrians and drivers is available for 74 countries in 46 different languages and there are maps for over 180 countries. This gives you the best maps with the largest global coverage for free.,7.7 x 7.3 x 1.4 inches,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41orhALXGML._SL500_AA300_.jpg,4.8 ounces,14.4 ounces,,"<ul><li>Unlocked quad-band GSM cell phone compatible with 850/900/1800/1900 frequencies and US/International 3G compatibility via 850/900/1700/1900/2100 UMTS/HSDPA plus GPRS/EDGE capabilities</li><li>3G-enabled smartphone in blue with 3.5-inch AMOLED touchscreen and Symbian^3 operating system</li><li>12-MP camera with Carl Zeiss optics and 720p video capture; Wireless-N Wi-Fi; Bluetooth 3.0; 16 GB internal memory; microSD expansion; HDMI output</li><li>Up to 5.8 hours of 3G talk time, up to 400 hours (16.7 days) of standby time; released in August, 2010</li><li>What's in the Box: handset, rechargeable battery, compact travel charger, connectivity cable, adapter for HDMI, adapter for USB, wired stereo headset, quick start guide</li></ul>"
