# Avoid pushing unnecessary files
Please use .gitignore so we don't end up with .DS_Stores and similar nonsense on here. Remember to include .gitignore in .gitignore.

# Document commits
Please include brief but informative messages in each commit about what the commit is changing. Preferably in all lower case and starting with a present-tense verb. Ex: "fix import bug in myscript.py" or "add section 2 to prospectus"

# Filename conventions
Please use all lower case for file names, separating words with dashes. Ex: my-first-script.py
