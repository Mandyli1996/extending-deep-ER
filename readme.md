# README
This is the source code repository accompanying the computer systems project **Extending DeepER: A Closer Examination of Deep Learning for Entity Resolution**. As many files for this project were much too largeto include on Github, this repo is not yet set up to facilitate easy reproducibility. However, readers are welcome to examine the code and experiments. Code for preprocessing, creating train/validation/test splits, and model generation are located in **scripts**. Notebooks for each experiment are located in **notebooks**.
